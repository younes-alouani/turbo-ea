# Set by `OriginMiddleware` in `app.main` from the `X-Turbo-EA-Origin`

# admins can filter MCP-driven writes out of the audit log separately from
# web-UI actions. Unset (None) means a request without the header — typical
# web-UI or system-initiated event — and we omit the key entirely so the
# audit log stays clean for pre-existing rows.

# Set by the mutation-batch service when an MCP tool wrapper opens a batch
# at the start of a request. ``publish()`` stamps the batch id onto every

# Captured by the same middleware as ``request_origin``: the HTTP method +
# path of the in-flight request. Used to label auto-created batches when a
# web-UI or direct-API write publishes events without an MCP-style explicit
# batch — gives admins something more useful than "POST /api/v1/cards" in
# the audit log's Tool column.

# Set by ``capture_request_origin`` in ``app.main`` when the request's JWT
# carries an ``impersonated_role`` claim — i.e. an admin has activated a
# "View as role" session from the user menu. Tuple is
# (impersonator_user_id, impersonated_role_key). ``publish()`` stamps both
# onto every event's data payload so an auditor can later reconstruct
# "who, real-identity-wise, performed this action while pretending to be
# what role". Permission checks read this via
# ``PermissionService._effective_role(user)`` to evaluate the impersonated
# role instead of the user's real role.

# the underlying card / relation / ADR / risk write that triggered them is
# already captured by its own event under the same request, so the
# notification event alone would just create a noisy duplicate batch. The
# ``event.stream.`` / ``kpi.`` prefixes are reserved for any future
# per-user UI-state events (none today). MCP-driven publishes are
# unaffected — they always carry an explicit batch_id and short-circuit
