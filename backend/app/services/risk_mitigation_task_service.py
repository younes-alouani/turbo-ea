"""Mitigation-task service: occurrence lifecycle, recurrence, Todo sync, events.

Owns the per-occurrence state machine. The API layer in
``app/api/v1/risk_mitigation_tasks.py`` is a thin permission + serialization
wrapper around these helpers.

Recurrence is **completion-driven**: when an occurrence is marked done or
skipped, the next occurrence is created with ``due_date`` shifted by the
task's recurrence rule (calendar-correct month/year math — Jan 31 + 1
month → Feb 28). The first occurrence is created when the task itself is
created. One-shot tasks flip ``is_active = False`` once their single
occurrence terminates, so the UI can grey them out.

Each terminal transition snapshots ``task.owner_id`` into the occurrence's
``owner_at_completion`` column — that snapshot is the auditable answer to
"who signed off on the Jan 2024 review?" even after years of owner rotation.

**Lead-time gated visibility.** A new cycle lands as ``scheduled`` if the
current date is outside the task's lead-time window (``due_date -
lead_time_days``). Scheduled occurrences carry zero side effects — no
Todo, no notification — they exist purely for audit ("next review: due
2026-11-15"). The daily promotion loop in ``app.main`` calls
``promote_scheduled_occurrences`` to flip them to ``open`` when the
window opens, at which point the standard Todo + ``task_assigned``
notification fire. Users with ``risks.manage`` can also short-circuit
the wait via ``promote_single_occurrence``.

Todo synchronization mirrors the risk-owner pattern in
``api/v1/risks.py::sync_owner_todo``: one ``is_system`` Todo per **open**
occurrence keyed by a deep link, recreated for each new cycle of a
recurring task. Scheduled occurrences own no Todo.
