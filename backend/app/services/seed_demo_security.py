"""NexaTech Industries demo — TurboLens Compliance findings.

Hand-curated compliance gap examples so that a fresh ``SEED_DEMO=true`` boot
lands users on a populated **GRC → Compliance** tab (and the Card Detail
Compliance tab) without needing an AI provider configured.

Idempotent: skips if any ``TurboLensComplianceFinding`` row already exists.

Can be triggered:
  1. Automatically via ``SEED_DEMO=true`` (full demo experience)
  2. Incrementally via ``SEED_SECURITY=true`` on an existing instance that
     already has the base NexaTech cards from ``seed_demo``.

Re-running an actual scan later upserts cleanly by the natural ``finding_key`` —
seeded user-state will survive.
