# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first screen you see after logging in. It provides a **quick overview** of the entire enterprise architecture status.

## Top Navigation Bar

At the top of the screen, you will find the **main navigation bar** with the following elements:

- **Turbo EA** (logo): Click to return to the Dashboard from any section
- **Dashboard**: Overview of the architecture status
- **Inventory**: Complete listing of all cards
- **Reports**: Visual and analytical reports
- **BPM**: Business Process Management (if enabled)
- **Diagrams**: Visual architecture diagram editor
- **EA Delivery**: Architecture initiative management
- **Todos**: Pending tasks and assigned surveys
- **Search cards**: Quick search bar with autocomplete
- **+ Create**: Button to quickly create new cards
- **Notification bell**: System alerts and [notifications](notifications.md)
- **Profile icon**: Language selection, theme toggle, notification preferences, and administration access

## Summary Cards

The main section of the Dashboard displays **summary cards** indicating:

- **Total number of cards**: Count of all components registered in the platform
- **Distribution by type**: How many elements of each type exist (Applications, Organizations, Objectives, Capabilities, etc.)
- **Status overview**: Quick visualizations of the overall status

Clicking on a type card navigates to the [Inventory](inventory.md) pre-filtered to that type.

## Charts and Statistics

In the bottom section of the Dashboard you will find:

- **Distribution by type chart**: Shows the proportion of each card type in your landscape
- **Approval status**: Indicates how many cards are approved, pending, broken, or rejected
- **Data quality**: Overall percentage of information completeness across all cards
- **Recent activity**: A feed of the latest changes — who edited what and when

## Workspace tab

The **Workspace** tab pulls together everything assigned to you: favorites, todos, pending surveys, recent activity on your cards, and the **Cards I Have a Role In** section.

That last section groups cards by the stakeholder role you hold (Application Owner, Business Owner, etc.) and lists the cards under each. If your role grants the `stakeholders.view` permission (admin, member and viewer roles by default), a small **person search** icon next to the section title lets you point it at **someone else** — pick a user from the autocomplete and the section refetches and re-renders with that user's roles and cards. The section title flips to "Roles held by {name}". Click the small close icon to return to your own roles. Useful for answering "what does this person own?" in one click.

## Admin tab — Stakeholder directory

Administrators (any role with `admin.users`) get a **Stakeholder directory** widget at the bottom of the Admin tab. It lists every card type that has at least one stakeholder, with the count of distinct holders for each. Expand a card type to see its roles, and inside each role the users who hold it together with the number of cards they cover. This is the org-wide answer to "who is responsible for what?", in one screen and one click per card type.

The widget chips are **hover-aware**: pause the cursor on any user chip in the directory — or on a stakeholder name in a card's Stakeholders tab, or on a risk owner in the Risk Register / Risk Detail page — and a small popover opens showing that user's full role-grouped stakeholder portfolio. Click any card in the popover to jump straight to it. The popover only fetches once per user per session.
