# Risk Register

The **Risk Register** captures architecture risks through their full lifecycle — from identification to mitigation, residual assessment, monitoring and closure (or formal acceptance). It lives as the **Risk** tab of the [GRC module](grc.md) at `/grc?tab=risk`.

## TOGAF alignment

The register implements the Architecture Risk Management process from **TOGAF ADM Phase G — Implementation Governance** (TOGAF 10 §27):

| TOGAF step | What you capture |
|-----------|------------------|
| Risk classification | `Category` (security, compliance, operational, technology, financial, reputational, strategic) |
| Risk identification | `Title`, `Description`, `Source` (manual or promoted from a TurboLens finding) |
| Initial assessment | `Initial probability × Initial impact → Initial level` (derived automatically) |
| Mitigation | One or more **Mitigation tasks** — owned work items, one-shot or recurring (see [Mitigation tasks](#mitigation-tasks) below). The risk also carries an `Owner` and a `Target resolution date`. |
| Residual assessment | `Residual probability × Residual impact → Residual level` (editable once mitigation is planned). Stays a **manual** assessment — task completion does not auto-adjust it. The detail page surfaces a "X/Y open · Z overdue" task summary alongside the residual block as context for the human judgement (ISO 31000-aligned). |
| Monitoring / acceptance | `Status` workflow: identified → analysed → mitigation_planned → in_progress → mitigated → monitoring → closed (with an `accepted` side-branch requiring an explicit rationale) |

## Creating a risk

Two paths both land in the same **Create risk** dialog — each variant prefills different fields so you can edit and submit:

1. **Manual** — Risks tab → **+ New risk**. Blank form.
2. **From a compliance finding** — GRC → Compliance → **Create risk** on a non-compliant finding. Pre-fills category `compliance`, probability/impact from regulation severity + status, description from requirement + gap.

Both variants include **Owner**, **Category**, and **Target resolution date** fields so you can assign accountability at creation time — no need to re-open the risk to add them.

Promotion is **idempotent** — once a finding has been promoted its button flips to **Open risk R-000123** and navigates straight to the risk detail page.

## Ownership → Todo + notification

Assigning an **owner** to the risk (either at create time or later) automatically:

- Creates a **system Todo** on the owner's Todos page. The description reads `[Risk R-000123] <title>`, the due date mirrors the risk's target resolution date, and the link jumps back to the risk detail. The Todo auto-marks as **done** when the risk reaches `mitigated` / `monitoring` / `accepted` / `closed`.
- Fires a **bell notification** (`risk_assigned`) — shown in the bell dropdown and the notifications page, with optional email if the user has opted in. Self-assignment also fires the bell, so the trail is consistent across team and personal workflows.

Clearing or reassigning the owner keeps the Todo in sync — the old one is removed / reassigned.

The same plumbing fires independently for **each mitigation task** on the risk, so a contributor only sees the work they own — see [Mitigation tasks](#mitigation-tasks) below.

## Linking risks to cards

Risks are **many-to-many** with Cards. A risk can affect multiple Applications or IT Components, and a Card can have multiple risks linked to it:

- From the risk detail page: **Affected cards** panel → search and add. Click an `×` to unlink.
- From any Card detail page: new **Risks** tab lists every risk linked to that card, with a one-click path back to the register.

## Mitigation tasks

Mitigation is captured as **owned work items**, not free-text. On the risk detail page the **Mitigation tasks** panel replaces the old single-field "mitigation plan" — each row is a real task with its own owner, due date, history and (optionally) a recurrence rule.

### One-shot vs. recurring

A mitigation task is **one-shot** by default — fitness-for-purpose for "Roll out MFA", "Sign updated SCCs", or any project-shaped piece of work. Toggle **Repeats** in the task dialog and you get a **recurring control review**: e.g. "Re-attest cross-border transfer documentation every 12 months", "Run the OT incident response tabletop every 3 months", "Audit Jenkins credentials every week".

Recurring tasks accumulate one **cycle** (`occurrence`) per period. The next cycle is created automatically when you close the current one — calendar-correct, so a monthly task due Jan 31 rolls to Feb 28, not March 3.

### The lead-time window

The whole point of a recurring control review is that the assignee gets reminded **just before the due date**, not the moment the previous cycle closed. Each recurring task carries a **Lead time** (days) — how many days before `due_date` the cycle becomes active and lands on the assignee's `/todos` list.

Each cycle therefore moves through three visible states:

| Status | What it means | Visible on /todos? |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Scheduled** | The next cycle exists for audit ("next review: due 2026-11-15") but is dormant. Today is still outside the lead window. | No |
| **Open** | The lead window has opened. A system Todo is on the assignee's list with `[Risk R-000123] <task title>`; a `task_assigned` notification fires. | Yes (Open tab) |
| **Done** / **Skipped** | The assignee closed the cycle. The Todo flips to `done` so it stays in the assignee's **Done** tab as a history record. | Yes (Done tab) |

The task dialog suggests a sensible lead time per recurrence unit (1 day for daily, 2 for weekly, 7 for monthly, 14 for yearly — capped at half the cycle so the window never overlaps the previous occurrence). The hint auto-updates as you change unit or interval, until you edit the field yourself.

Once a day at **03:00 UTC** a background process scans every scheduled cycle and promotes the ones whose lead window has opened. Need to start a review early? Click **Activate now** (the lightning-bolt icon on the task row) to flip a scheduled cycle to open immediately — same Todo + notification machinery, just without the wait.

### Per-cycle audit history

Click the expand chevron on a task row to see its full cycle history. Every occurrence stamps:

- The **target due date** at scheduling time.
- Who was **assigned** at the moment the cycle opened (`assigned_owner_id`), so historical reviews keep their original owner even if you later rotate the role.
- For closed cycles: who **completed** it (`completed_by`), the timestamp, the **owner-at-completion** snapshot (may differ from the assigned owner if you rotated mid-cycle), and any free-text closure notes.
- For activated cycles: the **activation timestamp** (so audit can verify the daily promotion job fired on the right day).

This survives years of owner rotation cleanly — the audit answer to "who signed off on the Jan 2024 review?" is a single row away from the task, not lost to ownership rebalancing.

### Permissions & assignees

- **Add / edit / delete tasks** — needs `risks.manage` (admin / bpm_admin / member by default).
- **Complete the open cycle** — `risks.manage` **or** the user who is currently assigned to that cycle. So a Viewer assigned to a control review can close their own cycle without escalating.
- **Skip a cycle / Activate now** — always needs `risks.manage`. Skipping advances recurrence without claiming the work was done; activation pulls a scheduled cycle forward and is a planning action.

### Promoting from a TurboLens compliance finding

When you click **Create risk** on a non-compliant finding (see [TurboLens](turbolens.md#promote-a-finding-to-the-risk-register)) the new risk also gets a **one-shot mitigation task** seeded from the finding's remediation text — so the gap analysis turns into actionable, owned work on the spot.

### Export

The Risk Register's **Export** button writes a two-sheet `.xlsx`: sheet 1 is the filtered risk grid, sheet 2 is one row per cycle across every task on every risk in the same filter set, including the lead-time and activation timestamps. Use it for audit packs or for hand-off to stakeholders who don't have a Turbo EA login. Each task row in the detail panel also has its own **Export history** button for a per-task workbook.

## Risk matrix

Both the TurboLens Security Overview and the Risk Register page render a 4×4 probability × impact heatmap. Cells are **clickable** — click one to filter the list below to just that bucket, click again (or the chip's ×) to clear. On the Risk Register you can toggle the matrix between **Initial** and **Residual** views so mitigation progress shows up visually.

## Register grid

The register is an AG Grid that mirrors the [Inventory](inventory.md) standards: sortable, filterable, resizable columns with per-user persistent preferences (visible columns, sort order, sidebar state). A toolbar **+ New risk** opens the manual create dialog. The toolbar **Export** button writes a two-sheet `.xlsx` carrying the filtered risk grid on sheet 1 and one row per mitigation-task cycle on sheet 2 — see [Mitigation tasks → Export](#export) for the column shape.

## Risk ↔ Finding propagation

If a Risk was [promoted from a TurboLens finding](turbolens.md#promote-a-finding-to-the-risk-register), state changes flow **both ways**:

- The finding carries an **Open risk R-000123** back-link from the moment it is promoted (the action is idempotent — clicking it again navigates to the existing risk instead of creating a duplicate).
- When the Risk reaches `mitigated` / `monitoring` / `closed` / `accepted` (or is deleted), the back-propagation engine automatically transitions every linked compliance finding to match (`mitigated` / `verified` / `accepted` / `in_review`). The acceptance rationale you capture on the Risk is mirrored into the finding's review note so the audit trail stays consistent.

This keeps the Risk Register (governance view) and the Compliance grid (operational view) aligned without manual upkeep.

## Status workflow

The detail page always shows a single **primary Next step** button plus a smaller row of side actions, so the sequential path is obvious but governance escape hatches remain one click away:

| Current state | Next step (primary button) | Side actions |
|---|---|---|
| identified | Start analysis | Accept risk |
| analysed | Plan mitigation | Accept risk |
| mitigation_planned | Start mitigation | Accept risk |
| in_progress | Mark mitigated | Accept risk |
| mitigated | Start monitoring | Resume mitigation · Close without monitoring |
| monitoring | Close | Resume mitigation · Accept risk |
| accepted | — | Reopen · Close |
| closed | — | Reopen |

Full transition graph (enforced server-side):

```
identified → analysed → mitigation_planned → in_progress → mitigated → monitoring → closed
       │           │             │                │            ▲           ▲
       └───────────┴─────────────┴────────────────┴──── accepted (rationale required)
                                                              │
                              reopen → in_progress ◄──────────┘
```

- **Accepting** a risk requires an acceptance rationale. The user, timestamp and rationale are captured on the record.
- **Reopening** an `accepted` / `closed` risk goes back to `in_progress`. `mitigated` also allows a manual "Resume mitigation" without needing a full reopen.
