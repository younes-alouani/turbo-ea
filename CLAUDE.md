# Turbo EA

Self-hosted Enterprise Architecture Management platform that creates a **digital twin of a company's IT landscape**. Fully admin-configurable metamodel — card types, fields, subtypes, relations, stakeholder roles, and calculated fields are all data, not code.

**Current version**: see `/VERSION` (single source of truth for backend + frontend).

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # Edit secrets and DB credentials
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d          # Starts db + backend + frontend + edge nginx
```

The first user to register automatically gets the `admin` role. Set `SEED_DEMO=true` to pre-populate with the NexaTech Industries demo dataset. Add `--profile ai` to include the bundled Ollama container for AI description suggestions.

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working on this codebase, follow these conventions:

### General Principles
- **Data-driven metamodel**: Card types, fields, subtypes, relations, stakeholder roles, and calculated fields are all stored as data (JSONB) in the database, not hardcoded. Never add new card types or fields in code — add them via the seed or admin API.
- **Cards, not fact sheets**: The codebase was fully renamed from "fact sheets" to "cards". Never introduce the old terminology.
- **Permission checks are mandatory**: Every mutating endpoint must call `PermissionService.require_permission()` or use the `require_permission()` dependency. Never bypass permission checks.
- **No raw SQL**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM for all database queries. Alembic for all schema changes.

### Backend Conventions
- All route handlers live in `backend/app/api/v1/`, one file per resource domain.
- New routes must be registered in `backend/app/api/v1/router.py`.
- Use `async def` for all route handlers and database operations.
- Permission checking: use `PermissionService.require_permission(db, user, "permission.key")` or the `require_permission("permission.key")` FastAPI dependency from `deps.py`.
- New permission keys must be added to `backend/app/core/permissions.py` (the single source of truth for all valid permission keys).
- New models go in `backend/app/models/` (one file per table) and must be imported in `backend/app/models/__init__.py`.
- Schema changes require a new Alembic migration in `backend/alembic/versions/` with sequential numbering (e.g., `036_description.py`).
- **Built-in metamodel default changes need a migration too.** `seed.py` only runs when the relevant row is missing on startup, so editing a built-in card type's `color`, `icon`, `label`, etc. has zero effect on existing installs. If you change a built-in default, add a guarded `UPDATE` migration that only rewrites rows still carrying the drifted-from value (so admin customisations and pre-drift defaults are preserved). See `072_restore_business_process_color.py` for the canonical pattern.
- Sensitive values (SSO secrets, SMTP passwords) must use `encrypt_value()`/`decrypt_value()` from `backend/app/core/encryption.py`.
- Ruff linting: line length 100, rules E/F/I/N/W. Run `ruff check .` and `ruff format .`.
- **Before every commit**, run `cd backend && ruff format . && ruff check .` to ensure CI won't fail on formatting or lint errors. This is mandatory — do not skip it.
- **Public API surface is auto-documented**: `docs/api/openapi.json` is generated from `app.main:app` by `scripts/dump_openapi.py` and rendered in the user manual at `/admin/api/` via Swagger UI (loaded from the `swagger-ui-dist` CDN, same UI as FastAPI's `/api/docs`). Do not hand-edit it. The committed spec is **version-agnostic** — `dump_openapi.py` normalises `info.version` to the constant `"latest"` before writing, so VERSION bumps never produce drift. Handling:
  - **VERSION bumps**: nothing to do. The committed spec is version-agnostic, so a VERSION-only diff cannot cause CI drift. The live runtime spec served by the backend at `/api/openapi.json` keeps the real version (it's `app.openapi()` direct).
  - **Route or request/response schema changes**: run `python scripts/dump_openapi.py` and commit the result. There is intentionally no pre-commit hook for this — the script imports the whole backend app and we don't want every `backend/**` commit to pay that cost.
  - CI fails PRs whose spec has drifted; pushes to `main` auto-regenerate it via the `openapi-spec` workflow job, so it's recoverable if you forget.
- **Boot-time public settings belong in `/api/v1/settings/bootstrap`.** When you add a new small public setting that the frontend reads at boot (a feature toggle, a display preference, an enabled-list, etc.), add it to the response of `GET /settings/bootstrap` in `backend/app/api/v1/settings.py` instead of (or in addition to) creating a per-setting `GET` endpoint. The frontend calls bootstrap once after auth and primes hook caches from the result, so anything that lands here costs zero round-trips on subsequent navigations. Per-endpoint reads remain the right choice for selective refresh after admin edits.
- **Static-asset redirects must carry `Cache-Control`.** Any `RedirectResponse` whose target is a static file (the default logo, default favicon, etc.) must include `headers={"Cache-Control": "public, max-age=300"}`. The static target is already cached by nginx, but an un-cached 302 means every page navigation re-does the round-trip.
- **Macro Capabilities are an additive tier above L1** in the Capability Catalogue (consumed from the `turbo-ea-capabilities` wheel ≥ `2026.5.11.505`). Cards land with `type=BusinessCapability`, no subtype, `attributes.capabilityLevel = "Macro"`, and `attributes.catalogueId` prefixed `MC-`. The hierarchy depth limit relaxes from 5 to 6 for macro-rooted chains (`Macro → L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L5`); `_sync_capability_level` and `_check_hierarchy_depth` in `cards.py` detect macro roots by walking the parent chain. Macros never match existing cards by name — only by `catalogueId` — to avoid colliding with customer-named cards. Injection of macros into the catalogue payload happens in **one place** (`_resolve_active_catalogue` in `capability_catalogue_service.py`) so the GET endpoint and the import path see the same flat list with rewritten `parent_id`s — otherwise the auto-relink of pre-existing L1s silently no-ops.

### MCP Server Conventions
- The MCP server lives in `mcp-server/` — a separate Python package (`turbo-ea-mcp`) with its own `pyproject.toml` and Dockerfile.
- It provides AI tool access to EA data via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (FastMCP library).
- **Two transport modes**: HTTP/SSE (production, via Docker `--profile mcp`) and stdio (local testing with Claude Desktop).
- **Authentication**: In HTTP mode, users authenticate via OAuth 2.1 delegated to the Turbo EA SSO provider. The MCP server resolves OAuth tokens to Turbo EA JWTs. In stdio mode, `TURBO_EA_EMAIL`/`TURBO_EA_PASSWORD` env vars are used for direct login.
- **Read tools** (30, across eight clusters). **Cards & metamodel**: `search_cards`, `get_card`, `get_card_relations`, `get_card_hierarchy`, `list_card_types`, `get_relation_types`, `resolve_card_refs` (name-to-UUID pre-check), `analyze_impact` (dependency blast-radius for a proposed change). **Dashboards**: `get_dashboard`, `get_landscape`. **GRC (Risk Register)**: `list_risks`, `get_risk`, `get_risk_metrics`, `get_card_risks`. **GRC (Compliance)**: `list_compliance_findings`, `get_compliance_overview`. **Governance & Delivery**: `list_principles`, `list_adrs`, `get_adr`, `list_soaws`. **Reports**: `get_portfolio_report`, `get_cost_treemap`, `get_capability_heatmap`, `get_data_quality_report`. **Card context**: `get_card_stakeholders`, `get_card_comments`, `get_card_documents`. **Diagrams**: `list_diagrams`, `get_diagram`. (`resolve_card_refs` carries a read annotation — it resolves only, it never writes.)
- **Audit & change history** (1, read). `get_change_history(batch_id?, actor_user_id?, tool_name?, origin?, limit?)` surfaces the mutation-batch ledger so agents and admins can reconstruct exactly what a previous MCP commit changed from a single id. Wraps `GET /mutation-batches` and `GET /mutation-batches/{id}/events`.
- **Write tools** (17, annotated additive or destructive). **Additive** (13, `_WRITE_ADDITIVE_ANNOT`): `transition_card_lifecycle`, `create_risks`, `update_risks`, `add_card_comment`, `create_soaw`, `assign_stakeholders`, `update_cards_bulk`, `create_adr`, `update_adr`, `sign_adr`, `create_cards_bulk`, `create_diagram`, `import_bpmn`. **Destructive** (4, `_WRITE_DESTRUCTIVE_ANNOT`): `rollback_batch`, `update_diagram`, `archive_cards`, `upsert_relations_bulk`. The artifact-import subset (`create_cards_bulk` → `POST /cards/bulk-create`; `upsert_relations_bulk` → `POST /relations/bulk`; `create_diagram` → `POST /diagrams`; `import_bpmn` → find-or-create `BusinessProcess` then `PUT /bpm/processes/{id}/diagram`) lands structured rows the agent has read from its own context (spreadsheets, BPMN XML, DrawIO XML, PDFs, images). **Dry-run by default**: every mutating tool defaults to `dry_run=True`, which runs every validator and resolver server-side then rolls the transaction back so the agent can show the user a preview before committing. The backend's mutating endpoints carry the matching `dry_run: bool = False` request flag; `event_bus.publish` calls and side-effect emitters are gated on `not dry_run` so a preview never leaks events. Adding more mutating tools warrants careful security review.
- **All data access respects RBAC**: The user's JWT is passed through to the backend API, so permission checks are enforced server-side. Write tools require the same permissions as the underlying REST routes — e.g. `inventory.create` / `inventory.edit` / `inventory.archive`, `relations.manage`, `diagrams.manage`, `bpm.edit`, `risks.manage`, `comments.create`, `stakeholders.manage`, `soaw.create`, `adr.create` / `adr.sign`.
- **Write-tool guardrails.** Defense in depth so an LLM mishap can't cause mass damage. (a) Per-call size caps on the MCP path — defaults `MCP_MAX_CARDS_PER_CALL=200`, `MCP_MAX_RELATIONS_PER_CALL=500`. The underlying backend bulk endpoints still accept up to 2000/5000 for the legitimate Excel-importer UI, but the MCP tool wrappers reject larger payloads before forwarding. (b) `upsert_relations_bulk` refuses `action: "delete"` ops by default — relations should be removed from the web UI for an auditable trail; flip `MCP_ALLOW_RELATION_DELETE=true` only when an operator explicitly opts in. (c) Kill switch — `MCP_WRITES_ENABLED=false` disables all 17 write tools without a code redeploy; read tools keep working. (d) Audit origin — the MCP server sends `X-Turbo-EA-Origin: mcp` on every backend call; the `capture_request_origin` middleware in `app.main` mirrors it into the `request_origin` contextvar that `event_bus.publish` stamps into the event data payload (`{"origin": "mcp"}`) so admins can filter MCP-driven writes out of the timeline. Header values are whitelisted to `{mcp, web, api}` — any other value is dropped. (e) The toolset deliberately omits **hard card delete** (permanent deletion). Bulk-update and archive *are* exposed (`update_cards_bulk`, `archive_cards`) but archive is recoverable (soft-delete with a 30-day restore window) and both are annotated/dry-run-gated; any future MCP tool that performs an *irreversible* mutation (hard delete, force-purge) needs an RFC discussion first.
- **Mutation batches.** Every MCP write call opens a `mutation_batches` row (`POST /mutation-batches`) before any writes, threads the resulting `batch_id` through every subsequent backend call via the `X-Turbo-EA-Batch` header, and closes the batch on success (`POST /mutation-batches/{id}/commit`). The same middleware that captures `X-Turbo-EA-Origin` mirrors the batch id into the `request_batch_id` contextvar so `event_bus.publish` stamps every event emitted during the request with that id — admins (or the `get_change_history` MCP tool) can then reconstruct the full per-event diff of a single batch from one id. Commits above `MCP_BATCH_CONFIRMATION_THRESHOLD` (default 20 rows) must echo back a one-shot `confirm_token` issued by the prior dry-run; the token has a 15-minute TTL. The MCP wrapper enforces the gate at the agent edge; the backend enforces it again on `POST /mutation-batches/{id}/commit`. The wrapper helper lives in `mcp-server/turbo_ea_mcp/batches.py`; the standardised mutation pattern is documented on its `mutation_batch` async-context-manager. **All 47 MCP tools carry `ToolAnnotations`** (`readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint`) so connectors can surface destructiveness in their UI.
- **Config** is in `mcp-server/turbo_ea_mcp/config.py` — reads from env vars (`TURBO_EA_URL`, `TURBO_EA_PUBLIC_URL`, `MCP_PUBLIC_URL`, `MCP_PORT`, plus the six guardrail vars `MCP_WRITES_ENABLED`, `MCP_MAX_CARDS_PER_CALL`, `MCP_MAX_RELATIONS_PER_CALL`, `MCP_ALLOW_RELATION_DELETE`, `MCP_BATCH_CONFIRMATION_THRESHOLD`, `MCP_REQUIRE_DRYRUN_FIRST`).
- **Tests** live in `mcp-server/tests/` and use `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio`. Run with `cd mcp-server && pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest`.
- The MCP server shares the `/VERSION` file with backend/frontend for version consistency.

### Platform Migration Conventions

The **Admin → Settings → Migration** importer ingests workspace exports from third-party EA platforms (LeanIX today; Ardoq, Mega HOPEX, BiZZdesign, Avolution Abacus, … in the future) and lands them as Turbo EA cards, relations, tags, stakeholders, documents, comments, and metamodel extensions. The importer is built around an **adapter pattern** so adding a new source platform is a self-contained module — no schema churn, no pipeline rewrites, no route changes.

**Module layout** (`backend/app/services/migration/`):

```
migration/
  __init__.py          # re-exports MigrationSource, SOURCES, MigrationSnapshot, …
  protocol.py          # MigrationSource Protocol — the adapter contract
  registry.py          # SOURCES dict + register_source() + get_source()
  snapshot.py          # source-neutral typed payloads (SourceEntity, Relation,
                       # Subscription, Tag, Document, Comment, UserRef,
                       # MetamodelType/Field/RelationType, MigrationSnapshot)
  staging.py           # source-agnostic staging pipeline (takes MigrationSource arg)
  apply.py             # source-agnostic apply pipeline (12 dependency-ordered passes)
  sources/
    __init__.py        # registers every built-in adapter at import time
    leanix/            # SAP LeanIX adapter
      adapter.py       # LeanixSource implementing MigrationSource
      mappings.py      # TYPE_MAPPING, RELATION_MAPPING, FLIP_DIRECTION,
                       # FIELD_TYPE_MAPPING, SUBSCRIPTION_ROLE_MAPPING,
                       # HIERARCHY_RELATIONS
      xlsx_parser.py   # parser → MigrationSnapshot
```

**DB schema** is uniform across sources (`backend/app/models/migration.py`): `migrations`, `staged_records`, `migration_identity_map` tables, each carrying a `source_type` discriminator column. Identity-map uniqueness is `(source_id, entity_kind, source_type)`; file-hash uniqueness is `(file_hash, source_type)`. Same shape for every source.

**HTTP routes** (`backend/app/api/v1/migration.py`) are source-neutral too: `GET /migration/sources`, `POST /migration/upload` (with `source_key` on the form), `GET /migration`, `GET /migration/{id}`, `GET /migration/{id}/preview`, `POST /migration/{id}/apply`, `DELETE /migration/{id}`. Gated by the single `admin.migrate` permission across all sources.

#### Adding a new source platform

To add an Ardoq / HOPEX / BiZZdesign / etc. adapter, the only surface area is a new subpackage under `sources/` plus one import line. Backend pipeline, DB schema, HTTP routes, frontend UI, and permission gating are all untouched.

1. **Create the adapter subpackage** at `backend/app/services/migration/sources/<key>/`:
   - **`mappings.py`** — five module-level constants the staging pipeline reads via the adapter: `TYPE_MAPPING: dict[str, str]` (native entity-type → TEA card-type key), `RELATION_MAPPING: dict[str, str]` (native relation name → TEA relation-type key, both wire-format flavours if the source has more than one), `FLIP_DIRECTION: frozenset[str]` (native relation types whose direction is the reverse of TEA's convention), `FIELD_TYPE_MAPPING: dict[str, str]` (native field-data-type string → TEA `fields_schema` type), `SUBSCRIPTION_ROLE_MAPPING: dict[str, str]` (lowercased native role-name → TEA stakeholder-role key). Optional: `HIERARCHY_RELATIONS: frozenset[str]` — relations the parser folds into `SourceEntity.parent_id` and that staging must skip.
   - **`<format>_parser.py`** — reads the source's export format off disk and returns a `MigrationSnapshot`. The dataclasses in `snapshot.py` are source-neutral, so the parser stays small and focused. Always read the file via `BytesIO` if you use openpyxl or any extension-checking library — uploads land on disk with a `.bin` suffix.
   - **`adapter.py`** — `class <Source>Source` implementing the `MigrationSource` Protocol (`backend/app/services/migration/protocol.py`). Required attributes/methods: `key`, `label`, `accepted_extensions`, `validate_payload(head: bytes) -> bool` (magic-byte signature check), `parse(path) -> MigrationSnapshot`, the five mapping dicts (re-exported from `mappings.py`), and two extension hooks: `post_build_card_payload(entity, target_type, payload)` (apply source-specific quirks the mapping tables can't express — e.g. LeanIX's `UserGroup → Organization w/ subtype="team"` writes a `source_origin = "<key>:UserGroup"` attribute) and `map_subscription_role(role_name, role_type) -> str` (free-form role-name → TEA role key with a sensible fallback).
   - **`__init__.py`** — `from app.services.migration.registry import register_source; from .adapter import <Source>Source; register_source(<Source>Source())`. Registration happens at import time.

2. **Wire the subpackage into the built-in source list** in `backend/app/services/migration/sources/__init__.py`: add `from app.services.migration.sources import <key>  # noqa: F401`. That's the only place outside the new subpackage that needs to change.

3. **Tests** — mirror the LeanIX layout: `backend/tests/services/test_migration_<key>_parser.py` (parser unit tests with synthetic export payloads built in-memory; never check in real customer data). The staging + apply tests in `test_migration_staging.py` / `test_migration_apply.py` are source-agnostic and don't need duplicates; just make sure the new adapter is covered by the registry contract test in `test_migration_registry.py` (assert `SOURCES["<key>"]` resolves and exposes the expected `label`/`accepted_extensions`).

4. **Frontend** — no changes required. The source picker in `MigrationAdmin.tsx`'s upload dialog reads from `GET /migration/sources`, so the new adapter shows up automatically. The file picker's `accept=` attribute is driven by the adapter's `accepted_extensions`.

5. **i18n** — no new keys required. The picker uses the adapter's `label` directly; the staging/apply UI is source-agnostic and uses the existing `migration.*` keys in all 8 locales.

6. **Docs** — update `docs/admin/migration.md` (+ 7 locale variants `.de`/`.fr`/`.es`/`.it`/`.pt`/`.zh`/`.ru`) to add the new source to the **Supported sources** table at the top. If the new source has format-specific guidance (e.g. how to obtain the export), add a short subsection like the existing LeanIX one. Keep the workflow / re-running / permissions sections generic.

7. **Database schema** — **no Alembic migration**. The three tables (`migrations`, `staged_records`, `migration_identity_map`) are source-uniform; the only per-source DB knowledge is the `source_type` value, which is just a string. Adding a Postgres CHECK constraint on `source_type` would be tempting but is intentionally avoided — the registry is the source of truth and the route layer rejects unknown keys before any insert.

8. **Permissions** — no change. All sources share the single `admin.migrate` permission. Splitting into per-source permissions (`admin.migrate.<key>`) is deferred until a customer actually requests it (the registry already knows the key, so splitting later is a five-minute change).

**Guardrails when writing an adapter**:

- **Mapping dicts on the adapter, not inlined**. Module-level constants in `mappings.py` keep the LX/Ardoq-specific knowledge in one obvious place. Resist the temptation to special-case in `staging.py`.
- **Source-specific quirks belong in `post_build_card_payload`**, not in the staging pipeline. If a source needs more than a simple mapping (e.g. force a subtype, rewrite an attribute, tag the origin), express it as a payload mutation in the hook. The hook is allowed to be empty for adapters that don't need it.
- **Don't expand the `MigrationSource` Protocol** without a second adapter actually needing the new method. YAGNI applies — `post_build_card_payload` + `map_subscription_role` covered every LeanIX quirk; the next adapter likely needs the same two, possibly nothing more.
- **Identity map is keyed by `(source_id, entity_kind, source_type)`**. Two sources can legitimately share an external id; the schema reflects that and the staging pipeline's identity-resolution queries already filter by `source_type` via `migration.source_type`. Never strip the `source_type` filter from a query.
- **Snapshot dataclasses are source-neutral** — don't add source-specific fields to `SourceEntity` / `Relation` / etc. Stuff source-specific data into `raw` or `custom_fields` instead.
- **The apply pipeline is source-agnostic**. It walks `entity_kind` rows by action; it never reads the adapter. If you find yourself wanting to dispatch on `source_type` in `apply.py`, push the logic into a per-source extension hook on the adapter instead.
- **Hierarchy edges go on `SourceEntity.parent_id`** at parse time (via the optional `HIERARCHY_RELATIONS` set + a parser pass). Never let a hierarchy edge surface as a Turbo EA relation.

### Frontend Conventions
- Route-level pages use `lazy()` imports in `App.tsx` for code splitting.
- Shared hooks in `src/hooks/`, shared components in `src/components/`.
- Feature-specific components go in `src/features/{feature}/`.
- Use `api.get()`, `api.post()`, `api.patch()`, `api.delete()` from `src/api/client.ts` for all API calls.
- JWT token is in `sessionStorage` (not localStorage). Use `setToken()`/`clearToken()` from `client.ts`.
- **Boot-time singleton hooks must use the inflight-promise pattern.** Hooks that fetch a process-wide value once (`useMetamodel`, `useDateFormat`, `useCurrency`, `useBpmEnabled`, `usePpmEnabled`, `useTurboLensReady`, …) keep a module-level `_cache` plus an `_inflight: Promise | null`. The fetch helper checks **both** — if `_cache` has the value, return it; if `_inflight` is non-null, return that promise; only otherwise start a new fetch and store it in `_inflight`, clearing it on settle. The naive `if (_cache === null) _fetch()` pattern races: when several components mount in the same tick they each see an empty cache and each fire their own request. Add an inflight guard to any new singleton hook of this shape.
- **For new boot-time settings, prefer adding to `/settings/bootstrap` over creating a new singleton hook.** The frontend's `primeBootstrap()` (in `src/api/bootstrap.ts`) calls `GET /settings/bootstrap` once after login and pushes each value into the corresponding hook's singleton cache via the hook's top-level `invalidate*(value)` export. Every per-hook GET that fires before bootstrap arrives is a wasted round-trip; every value bootstrap doesn't carry is a duplicate fetch. When you add a settings hook, also add a top-level `invalidate*(value)` export, extend `BootstrapResponse` in `bootstrap.ts`, and call your invalidator from `primeBootstrap()`.
- All TypeScript interfaces live in `src/types/index.ts`.
- Use MUI 6 components — do not introduce other UI libraries.
- Icons use Google Material Symbols via the `MaterialSymbol` component.
- When nesting MUI Dialogs, use `disableRestoreFocus` on inner dialogs.
- **Design tokens**: All colors, spacing aliases, icon sizes, and typography defaults live in `frontend/src/theme/tokens.ts` (re-exported from `frontend/src/theme/index.ts`). Never hardcode hex codes — import the named token (`STATUS_COLORS.success`, `SEVERITY_COLORS.high`, `LAYER_COLORS["Application & Data"]`, etc.). See [`frontend/UI_GUIDELINES.md`](frontend/UI_GUIDELINES.md) for the full design system, layout patterns, and do's/don'ts.
- **Dependency diagrams — Layered Dependency View (LDV)**: All dependency visualizations (Dependencies Report, Card Detail dependency section, TurboLens Architect target architecture) use Turbo EA's house notation, the **Layered Dependency View**. Cards are grouped into the four EA layers (Strategy & Transformation → Business Architecture → Application & Data → Technical Architecture) as swim lanes; nodes are colored by card type; edges follow metamodel `relation_type` direction with the forward label; proposed/uncommitted cards have a dashed border + green "NEW" badge. Inspired by ArchiMate's layering and the C4 Model's "good defaults" philosophy, but distinct from both — do **not** describe it as "C4" in user-facing strings or documentation. The renderer is `frontend/src/features/reports/C4DiagramView.tsx` + `c4Layout.ts` (file/symbol names retained for compatibility); reuse it for any new dependency view. See `frontend/UI_GUIDELINES.md` § 3.10 for the full spec.

### Internationalization (i18n)
- **All user-facing strings must use translation keys**, never hardcoded English text. Use `useTranslation()` from `react-i18next` with the appropriate namespace.
- **14 namespaces**: `common`, `auth`, `nav`, `inventory`, `cards`, `reports`, `admin`, `bpm`, `ppm`, `diagrams`, `delivery`, `grc`, `notifications`, `validation`. Use the namespace that matches the feature area.
- **9 supported locales**: `en` (English, baseline), `de` (German), `fr` (French), `es` (Spanish), `it` (Italian), `pt` (Portuguese), `zh` (Chinese Simplified), `ru` (Russian), `da` (Danish).
- **English is the source of truth**. All keys must exist in `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en/{namespace}.json` first. The i18n config uses `fallbackLng: "en"` and `returnEmptyString: false`, so missing or empty translations gracefully fall back to English.
- **Interpolation**: Use `{{variable}}` syntax for dynamic values (e.g., `"Selected {{count}} cards"`). Preserve these placeholders exactly when translating.
- **Plurals**: i18next uses `_one` / `_other` suffixes (e.g., `"count_one": "{{count}} item"`, `"count_other": "{{count}} items"`). All locales need both forms.
- **JSON safety**: Never use unescaped ASCII double quotes `"` inside JSON string values. For Chinese use corner brackets `「」`, for other languages use `«»` or escaped `\"`.
- **Metamodel labels** (card type names, field labels, relation labels) are translated separately via the `translations` JSONB column on `card_types` and `relation_types`. Use `useResolveLabel()` / `useResolveMetaLabel()` from `src/hooks/useResolveLabel.ts` to resolve these at render time.

#### Adding a New Language

The locale code is the ISO 639-1 two-letter code throughout (`da`, not `da-DK`). The recipe touches code in three layers (frontend, backend, docs) plus a one-shot data migration. PR [#623](https://github.com/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/pull/623) (Danish) is the canonical worked example.

1. **Frontend locale files**: copy `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en/` to `frontend/src/i18n/locales/{code}/` and translate the values in all 14 JSON files. Keys, placeholders, and `_one`/`_other` plural variants must match the English source exactly — verify with the JSON-parity check below.
2. **Frontend i18n config** (`frontend/src/i18n/index.ts`): add imports for all 14 namespace files, extend the `resources` object, append the code to the `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` tuple, and add a display label to `LOCALE_LABELS`. The `SupportedLocale` type updates automatically.
3. **Metamodel translations** (`backend/app/services/seed.py`): every `translations` dict on card types, subtypes, fields, sections, options, and relation types (label + reverse_label) needs the new locale. A Python regex pass that walks every leaf `"de":` dict and injects the matching value before the closing brace works well — see PR #623's `/tmp/add_da_seed.py` helper for the pattern.
4. **Backend allow-lists** — extend the hardcoded `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` in **both** places: `backend/app/api/v1/settings.py` (governs the `/settings/enabled-locales` validator and the `/settings/bootstrap` fallback) and `backend/app/api/v1/users.py` (governs the `users.locale` write validator). Keeping them in sync is enforced by convention only — there is no shared constant today.
5. **Test fixtures** — bump the hardcoded locale lists in `backend/tests/services/test_i18n_seed.py` (metamodel translation completeness check) and `frontend/src/i18n/i18n.test.ts` (placeholder/plural parity check). Both are pinned arrays, not imports, so they will not pick up the new locale automatically.
6. **MkDocs config** (`mkdocs.yml`) — **two places**: (a) a new language block under `plugins.i18n.languages` with `locale`, `name`, `build: true`, and a full `nav_translations` map mirroring the existing locales; (b) a matching entry in `theme.alternate` (the header dropdown). Omitting `theme.alternate` builds the `/{code}/` site but leaves users no way to switch into it from the UI. Add the code to `plugins.search.lang` as well — `lunr-languages` supports `da` and the major locales out of the box.
7. **Backend `User.locale`**: no migration needed — the column is `String(10)` with no enum constraint.
8. **Backfill existing installs**: an admin who has touched **Admin → Settings → Languages** at least once has the full locale list persisted as `app_settings.general_settings.enabledLocales` (JSONB). That stored list will not pick up the new locale on its own, so the picker hides it even though the constant exposes it. Ship a small Alembic migration that walks the singleton `app_settings` row and appends the new locale if missing. The canonical implementation is `backend/alembic/versions/099_backfill_danish_enabled_locale.py` — Python-side fetch-mutate-update with a `CAST(:s AS jsonb)` write. Don't use a single SQL `UPDATE … jsonb_set(…) WHERE general_settings ? '...' AND … @> …`; the `?` JSONB key-existence operator interacts badly with SQLAlchemy's `text()` named-parameter scanner and silently rolls back in the migration runner.
9. **Docs translations**: create `.{code}.md` siblings for every English `.md` under `docs/` (top-level index, `getting-started/`, `beginners-guide/`, `guide/`, `admin/`, `reference/`). The site builds without them — mkdocs-static-i18n falls back to English per page — but the language picker existing without translated pages confuses users.
10. **Validate**:
    - `python3 -c "import json, glob; [json.load(open(f)) for f in glob.glob('frontend/src/i18n/locales/{code}/*.json')]"` — JSON validity.
    - A second parity script (en keys == new-locale keys, en placeholders == new-locale placeholders) catches the common omissions.
    - `cd backend && ruff format . && ruff check . && python -m pytest tests/services/test_i18n_seed.py -q`.
    - `cd frontend && npm run build && npm run test:run`.
    - `mkdocs build --strict` (catches broken links in the new docs).

Screenshots can stay in `docs/assets/img/en/` and the new docs can reference `../assets/img/en/...` — translating UI screenshots is a separate, optional pass.

#### Translation Checklist for Code Changes

Every change that introduces user-visible content must include translations. Before marking a task as complete, verify:

- [ ] **New UI strings**: Added translation keys to `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en/{namespace}.json` and all 8 non-English locale files (`de`, `fr`, `es`, `it`, `pt`, `zh`, `ru`, `da`). Never hardcode English text in components.
- [ ] **New metamodel content** (card types, subtypes, fields, options, sections, relation types): Added `"translations"` dicts with all 8 non-English locales in `backend/app/services/seed.py`.
- [ ] **New select options** (in seed data or reusable option arrays): Each option object includes a `"translations"` dict.
- [ ] **New field labels**: Each field in `fields_schema` includes a `"translations"` dict.
- [ ] **New section names**: Each section in `fields_schema` includes a `"translations"` dict.
- [ ] **New subtypes**: Each subtype includes a `"translations"` dict.
- [ ] **Interpolation preserved**: `{{variable}}` placeholders are identical across all locales.
- [ ] **Plurals**: Keys using counts include both `_one` and `_other` variants in all locales.
- [ ] **JSON valid**: No unescaped double quotes in JSON values. Chinese uses `「」`, others use `«»` or `\"`.

### Security Requirements
- Never store plaintext secrets in the database — use `encrypt_value()`.
- Never expose sensitive fields (password hashes, encrypted secrets) in API responses.
- Always validate user input via Pydantic schemas on the backend.
- Use parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM) — never construct SQL strings.
- New endpoints must use `Depends(get_current_user)` or `Depends(require_permission(...))`.
- Rate limiting is applied via `slowapi` — apply `@limiter.limit()` to auth-sensitive endpoints.

### Pull Request Conventions
- **Always use the PR template** at `.github/pull_request_template.md` when creating pull requests. Do not use a custom format — fill in the template sections exactly as defined.
- The PR template has four required sections: **Summary**, **Changes**, **Test Plan**, and **Checklist**. All must be completed.
- **Summary**: 1-3 sentences explaining what the PR does and why.
- **Changes**: Bulleted list of the key changes made.
- **Test Plan**: Describe how you verified the changes work. Always include the three CI checkboxes (all CI checks pass, manually tested, added/updated tests). Check the boxes that apply.
- **Checklist**: Review every item and check all that apply. These enforce the project's core conventions (permission checks, Alembic migrations, async handlers, data-driven metamodel, no exposed secrets). Do not remove unchecked items — leave them unchecked so reviewers can see what was considered.
- PR titles should be concise (under 72 characters) and describe the change, not the implementation.

### Changelog & Versioning Conventions
- **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** for every user-facing change. Add entries under the current version heading (e.g., `## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-22`). Do **not** use an `[Unreleased]` section — this project ships continuously and every change belongs to a concrete version.
- The changelog follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. Use these categories: **Added**, **Changed**, **Deprecated**, **Removed**, **Fixed**, **Security**. Only include categories that apply.
- Each entry should be a single concise line describing the change from the user's perspective, not implementation details.
- **Bump the version once per PR** (not per commit). All commits in a feature branch share one version. Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): bump **patch** (e.g., `0.6.0` → `0.6.1`) for bug fixes, **minor** (e.g., `0.6.0` → `0.7.0`) for new features, **major** for breaking changes.
- The single source of truth for the version is `/VERSION`. When bumping, only update `VERSION` (the backend reads it at runtime via `config.py`, the frontend injects it at build time via `vite.config.ts`). Do **not** edit `backend/pyproject.toml` or `frontend/package.json` — they use a static `"0.0.0"` placeholder to avoid triggering unnecessary CI jobs on version bumps.
- When bumping, add a new heading in `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version and today's date (e.g., `## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-22`), and place new entries under it.
- CI enforces this via `.github/workflows/version-check.yml`: any PR that touches `VERSION` is failed unless `CHANGELOG.md` has a matching `## [<version>]` heading. This prevents the Publish-GitHub-Release workflow from breaking later at tag time.

### Testing Conventions
- **Every new feature or bug fix should include tests.** CI will block PRs that fail lint or tests.
- **Backend tests** live in `backend/tests/` mirroring the source structure (`core/`, `services/`, `api/`).
- **Frontend tests** live next to source files (e.g., `client.ts` → `client.test.ts`).
- Backend integration tests use the savepoint-rollback pattern — each test runs in a transaction that rolls back automatically, so tests never pollute each other.
- The test database engine (`test_engine` in `conftest.py`) is a **sync** session-scoped fixture using `NullPool`. This avoids pytest-asyncio event loop mismatches — each test gets a fresh asyncpg connection on its own loop. Do not convert it to an async fixture.
- **Rate limiting is auto-disabled** in tests via an autouse fixture (`_disable_rate_limiter`). Tests should assert actual business logic status codes, not 429.
- Use the factory helpers in `backend/tests/conftest.py` (`create_user`, `create_card`, `create_card_type`, etc.) rather than inserting raw models. Note: `create_card_type` defaults to `built_in=False`; pass `built_in=True` explicitly when testing built-in type behavior.
- Frontend tests use Vitest + Testing Library. Mock the API client with `vi.mock("@/api/client")`, not the global fetch.
- Pure logic (calculation engine, BPMN parser, encryption, JWT) should have unit tests that need no database.
- **Seed demo data must stay compatible with the metamodel.** `test_seed_demo.py` validates that every card type, subtype, attribute key, select option, and relation type used in `seed_demo.py` and `seed_demo_bpm.py` matches the definitions in `seed.py`. When changing the metamodel, update the demo data or these tests will fail. `test_seed_demo_security.py` does the equivalent for `seed_demo_security.py` — it asserts that every card name referenced by the demo Compliance findings exists in `seed_demo.py`'s Application + IT Component list, and that every regulation key / lifecycle state used by the seed is valid. Rename a NexaTech demo card and these tests will catch the dangling reference.

**Running tests locally:**
```bash
# Backend — unit tests only (no database needed)
cd backend && python -m pytest tests/core/ tests/services/ -q

# Backend — all tests (auto-provisions ephemeral Postgres via Docker)
./scripts/test.sh

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm test          # watch mode
cd frontend && npm run test:run  # single run (CI mode)
```

### User Documentation (User Manual)

Every feature or UI change **must** include updates to the user manual. The user manual lives in `docs/` and is built with **MkDocs Material** + **mkdocs-static-i18n**. It deploys automatically to Cloudflare Pages on every push to `main`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full documentation guide — the rules below are the mandatory checklist for every change.

#### Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── index.md / index.{locale}.md          ← Homepage
├── assets/img/{en,es,de,...}/            ← Per-language screenshots
├── getting-started/                      ← Onboarding pages
├── guide/                                ← Feature documentation
├── admin/                                ← Administration guides
└── reference/glossary.md / .{locale}.md  ← Glossary
```

Files use **suffix-based** i18n: `page.md` is English (default), `page.es.md` is Spanish, `page.de.md` is German, etc. Untranslated pages fall back to English automatically.

#### When to Update Docs

| Change Type | Required Doc Update |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **New feature** | Add or update the relevant guide/admin page in **all supported languages** (currently `en` + locale suffixes for `es`, `de`, `fr`, `it`, `pt`, `zh`, `ru`, `da`). |
| **UI change** | Replace affected screenshots in **all locale folders** under `docs/assets/img/`. |
| **New admin setting** | Update the appropriate admin page (e.g., `docs/admin/settings.md`). |
| **New API endpoint** | Document in the relevant guide page if user-facing. |
| **Terminology change** | Update the glossary (`docs/reference/glossary.md` + all locale variants). |
| **New page** | Create `docs/path/page.md` (English) + all locale variants. Add to `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml` including locale-specific nav labels. |

#### Documentation Checklist for Code Changes

Before marking a feature task as complete, verify:

- [ ] **Guide page updated**: The relevant page under `docs/guide/` or `docs/admin/` describes the new/changed behavior in all supported languages.
- [ ] **Screenshots updated**: Any new or changed UI is captured in `docs/assets/img/{locale}/` for all locales. Follow the `NN_short_description.png` naming convention. **Every screenshot added to `scripts/screenshots/pages.ts` MUST also be referenced in the corresponding documentation page** (`docs/guide/` or `docs/admin/`) in ALL 8 locale files — otherwise the screenshot is captured but never displayed.
- [ ] **Screenshot script updated**: New pages/screens are added to `scripts/screenshots/pages.ts` (see section below). **Never add a screenshot to the script without also adding the `![Alt Text](../assets/img/{locale}/{filename}.png)` reference to the matching doc page in all locales.**
- [ ] **Navigation updated**: New pages are added to `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml` with translated labels for all locales.
- [ ] **Glossary updated**: New terms are added to `docs/reference/glossary.md` and all locale variants.
- [ ] **Grammar checked**: All documentation text has correct grammar, spelling, and diacritical marks (accents, umlauts, cedillas, tildes) in every supported language. Do not strip or omit diacritics — use proper characters (e.g., `ä ö ü ß` for German, `é è ê ç à` for French, `á é í ó ú ñ` for Spanish, `è é à ù ò` for Italian, `á â ã ç é ê í ó ô õ ú` for Portuguese).
- [ ] **Docs build passes**: Run `mkdocs build --strict` to verify no broken links or missing files.

#### Previewing Docs Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
mkdocs serve
# → http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Screenshot Automation

The project includes a **Playwright-based screenshot capture script** at `scripts/screenshots/` that automatically generates all documentation and marketing screenshots. When you add a new page, UI feature, or change existing UI, you **must** update the screenshot definitions so that automated captures stay in sync.

**IMPORTANT**: Screenshots and documentation are a **two-way contract**. Adding a screenshot to `pages.ts` without referencing it in the docs means it will be captured but never displayed. Adding an image reference in a doc without a `pages.ts` entry means it will never be auto-captured. Always update both together:
1. Add/update the entry in `scripts/screenshots/pages.ts` (with `filenames` for all 8 locales)
2. Add the `![Alt Text](../assets/img/{locale}/{filename}.png)` reference in the corresponding doc page in **all 8 locale files** (`.md`, `.de.md`, `.fr.md`, `.es.md`, `.it.md`, `.pt.md`, `.zh.md`, `.ru.md`)

#### How It Works

1. Launches headless Chromium via Playwright at 2x device scale (Retina quality).
2. Authenticates via `POST /api/v1/auth/login` and injects the JWT into `sessionStorage`.
3. Resolves card UUIDs from demo data (e.g., `{{cardId:sampleApp}}` → NexaCore ERP UUID).
4. Switches locale per capture run (EN, ES, etc.) via API + localStorage.
5. Navigates to each configured route, executes pre-capture actions (scroll, click, hover, wait), and saves screenshots to `docs/assets/img/{locale}/`.

#### Configuration

All screenshot definitions live in **`scripts/screenshots/pages.ts`**:

- **`DOC_PAGES`** array: Documentation screenshots (saved to `docs/assets/img/{locale}/`). Each entry has an `id`, `route`, optional `waitFor`/`actions`, and `filenames` per locale.
- **`MARKETING_PAGES`** array: Marketing site screenshots (saved to `marketing-site/assets/screenshots/`).
- **`CARD_LOOKUPS`**: Maps card names to search queries for UUID resolution from demo data.

Example entry:
```typescript
{
  id: "26_admin_settings_ai",
  route: "/admin/settings?tab=ai",
  waitFor: ".MuiPaper-root",
  actions: [{ type: "wait", ms: 600 }],
  filenames: {
    en: "26_admin_settings_ai",
    es: "26_admin_config_ia",
  },
},
```

#### When to Update the Screenshot Script

| Change Type | What to Update in `scripts/screenshots/pages.ts` |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **New page/route** | Add a new entry to `DOC_PAGES` with the next sequential `id` number. Include `filenames` for all supported locales (`en`, `es` at minimum). |
| **Changed route path** | Update the `route` field on the affected entry. |
| **New UI section requiring interaction** | Add `actions` (click tab, scroll, wait) to capture the specific state. |
| **New card type in demo data** | Add a `CARD_LOOKUPS` entry if the screenshot needs to navigate to a specific card. |
| **Removed page** | Remove the corresponding entry from `DOC_PAGES` or `MARKETING_PAGES`. |

#### Running the Screenshot Script

```bash
cd scripts/screenshots
npm install && npm run install-browsers

# Prerequisites: Turbo EA running with demo data
# SEED_DEMO=true docker compose up --build -d

npm run capture              # All docs + marketing, all locales
npm run capture:en           # English only
npm run capture:marketing    # Marketing screenshots only
npx tsx capture.ts --only 26 # Specific screenshot by ID prefix
npx tsx capture.ts --dry-run # Preview without saving files
```

**DrawIO** is self-hosted inside the frontend Docker image (cloned at build time from `jgraph/drawio` v26.0.9) and served under `/drawio/` by Nginx.

---

## Terminology

The codebase uses **"cards"** throughout (models, routes, UI). Earlier documentation may reference "fact sheets" — this has been fully renamed. The core entity table is `cards`, the API route is `/api/v1/cards`, and the frontend route is `/cards/:id`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTGRES_HOST` | `localhost` | PostgreSQL hostname |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | `5432` | PostgreSQL port |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `turboea` | Database name |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `turboea` | Database user |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `turboea` | Database password |
| `SECRET_KEY` | `change-me-in-production` | HMAC key for JWT signing. **Must** be changed in production (app refuses to start with default in non-development environments) |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | `1440` (24h) | JWT token lifetime |
| `HOST_PORT` | `8920` | Public HTTP port exposed on the host for the bundled edge nginx. Set `80` for direct HTTPS deployments with redirect support. |
| `TLS_HOST_PORT` | `9443` | Public HTTPS port exposed on the host when direct TLS is enabled. Set `443` for standard HTTPS deployments. |
| `RESET_DB` | `false` | Drop all tables and re-create + re-seed on startup |
| `SEED_DEMO` | `false` | Populate NexaTech Industries demo data on startup |
| `SEED_BPM` | `false` | Populate demo BPM processes |
| `SEED_PPM` | `false` | Populate demo PPM data (status reports, WBS, tasks, budgets, costs, risks) |
| `TURBO_EA_TLS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable direct TLS termination in the bundled edge nginx |
| `TLS_CERTS_DIR` | `./certs` | Host path mounted read-only at `/certs` inside the nginx container |
| `TURBO_EA_TLS_CERT_FILE` | `cert.pem` | Certificate filename inside `TLS_CERTS_DIR` |
| `TURBO_EA_TLS_KEY_FILE` | `key.pem` | Private-key filename inside `TLS_CERTS_DIR` |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `development` | Runtime environment. Controls: API docs visibility, secret key validation |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:8920` | CORS allowed origins (comma-separated) |
| `SMTP_HOST` | *(empty)* | SMTP server hostname (optional) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP server port |
| `SMTP_USER` | *(empty)* | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | SMTP password |
| `SMTP_FROM` | `noreply@turboea.local` | Sender email address |
| `SMTP_TLS` | `true` | Use TLS for SMTP |
| `AI_PROVIDER_URL` | *(empty)* | Ollama-compatible LLM provider URL (e.g., `http://ollama:11434`) |
| `AI_MODEL` | *(empty)* | LLM model name (e.g., `mistral`, `gemma3:4b`, `llama3:8b`) |
| `AI_SEARCH_PROVIDER` | `duckduckgo` | Web search provider for AI context: `duckduckgo`, `google`, or `searxng` |
| `AI_SEARCH_URL` | *(empty)* | Search provider URL: SearXNG URL or `API_KEY:CX` for Google |
| `AI_AUTO_CONFIGURE` | `false` | Auto-enable AI on startup if provider is reachable |
| `OLLAMA_MEMORY_LIMIT` | `4G` | Memory limit for bundled Ollama container (Docker `--profile ai`) |
| `TURBO_EA_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | (MCP server) Internal backend URL |
| `TURBO_EA_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://localhost:8920` | Public-facing Turbo EA URL for OAuth redirects and bundled nginx hostname/proto derivation |
| `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://localhost:8001` | (MCP server) Public URL for OAuth metadata |
| `MCP_PORT` | `8001` | (MCP server) Bind port |
| `MCP_WRITES_ENABLED` | `true` | (MCP server) Kill switch for all 5 write tools — set to `false` to put the MCP server into read-only mode without a code redeploy. Read tools keep working. |
| `MCP_MAX_CARDS_PER_CALL` | `200` | (MCP server) Per-call size cap for `create_cards_bulk`. The backend `/cards/bulk-create` endpoint still accepts up to 2000 for the legitimate Excel importer; the MCP wrapper enforces this lower cap so a dry-run preview stays reviewable. |
| `MCP_MAX_RELATIONS_PER_CALL` | `500` | (MCP server) Per-call size cap for `upsert_relations_bulk`. Backend accepts up to 5000 from the UI. |
| `MCP_ALLOW_RELATION_DELETE` | `false` | (MCP server) When `false` (default), `upsert_relations_bulk` refuses `action: "delete"` ops — relations must be removed via the web UI for an explicit audit trail. Set `true` only when an operator opts in. |

For local frontend dev without Docker, create `frontend/.env.development`:

## Database Schema

All tables use UUID primary keys and `created_at`/`updated_at` timestamps (from `UUIDMixin` + `TimestampMixin` in `backend/app/models/base.py`).

### Core Tables

| Table | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `users` | `User` | Email, display_name, password_hash, role_key (FK to roles), is_active, SSO fields, password_reset_token / password_reset_expires_at (local-account forgot-password flow) |
| `card_types` | `CardType` | Metamodel: types with key, label, icon, color, category, subtypes (JSONB), fields_schema (JSONB), section_config (JSONB), stakeholder_roles (JSONB), has_hierarchy, built_in, is_hidden, sort_order |
| `relation_types` | `RelationType` | Metamodel: allowed relations between types with label, reverse_label, cardinality, attributes_schema (JSONB) |
| `cards` | `Card` | The core entity. Type, subtype, name, description, parent_id (hierarchy), lifecycle (JSONB), attributes (JSONB), status, approval_status, data_quality (float 0-100), archived_at |
| `relations` | `Relation` | Links between cards. Type key, source_id, target_id, attributes (JSONB) |

### RBAC Tables

| Table | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `roles` | `Role` | App-level roles with key, label, color, permissions (JSONB), is_system, is_default, is_archived, sort_order |
| `stakeholder_role_definitions` | `StakeholderRoleDefinition` | Per-card-type stakeholder role definitions with permissions, is_archived |
| `stakeholders` | `Stakeholder` | User role assignments on specific cards |

### BPM Tables

| Table | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `process_diagrams` | `ProcessDiagram` | BPMN 2.0 XML storage linked to BusinessProcess cards |
| `process_elements` | `ProcessElement` | Extracted BPMN elements (tasks, events, gateways, lanes) |
| `process_flow_versions` | `ProcessFlowVersion` | Version history with approval workflow (draft/pending/published/archived) |
| `process_assessments` | `ProcessAssessment` | Process scores: efficiency, effectiveness, compliance |

### PPM Tables

## Frontend Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **MUI 6** (Material UI) for component library
- **React Router 7** for client-side routing
- **AG Grid** for data tables (inventory page)
- **Recharts** for charts (portfolio, cost, lifecycle reports)
- **bpmn-js** for BPMN 2.0 diagram editing
- **TipTap** for rich text editing (SoAW sections)
- **@dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop (card layout editor)
- **docx** + **file-saver** for DOCX export (SoAW)
- **xlsx** (vendored v0.20.3) for Excel import/export
- **Vite** for build tooling with `@` path alias to `./src`

### Routing (`App.tsx`)

### Key Patterns

**API Client** (`src/api/client.ts`): Thin fetch wrapper that auto-injects the JWT from `sessionStorage`. Methods: `api.get()`, `api.post()`, `api.patch()`, `api.put()`, `api.delete()`, `api.upload()`, `api.getRaw()`. Handles 204 empty responses and formats validation errors. Custom `ApiError` class with `status` and `detail` fields.

**Authentication** (`hooks/useAuth.ts`): Token stored in `sessionStorage.token` (cleared on tab close). On load, validates via `GET /auth/me`. SSO callback support via `/auth/callback`. Password setup for invited users via `/auth/set-password`.

**Metamodel Cache** (`hooks/useMetamodel.ts`): Module-level singleton cache. Fetches types + relation types once, shared across all components. `invalidateCache()` forces re-fetch.

**Permissions** (`hooks/usePermissions.ts`): Fetches effective permissions for a card by combining app-level role + stakeholder roles. Used by CardDetail to enable/disable edit controls.

**Calculated Fields** (`hooks/useCalculatedFields.ts`): Fetches `type_key → field_keys[]` map. CardDetail uses this to show "calc" badges and prevent manual editing of computed fields.

**Real-time Updates** (`hooks/useEventStream.ts`): SSE connection to `/events/stream`. Auto-reconnects on error. Badge count refresh debounced at 500ms via `AppLayout.tsx`.

**Currency** (`hooks/useCurrency.ts`): Module-level singleton cache. Provides `fmt()`, `fmtShort()`, and `symbol` for consistent cost display.

**Data Quality Scoring**: Backend auto-computes `data_quality` (0-100%) based on `fields_schema` weights. Approval status auto-breaks to `BROKEN` when approved items are edited.

**Card Detail Sections**: Each section is an independent component in `features/cards/sections/`, wrapped in `ErrorBoundary`. Section ordering is controlled by `section_config.__order` in the metamodel. Custom sections are rendered via `AttributeSection` (fully data-driven from `fields_schema`).

**Report Architecture**: Reports share `ReportShell` for consistent layout, `MetricCard` for KPI display, `ReportLegend` for legends, and `SaveReportDialog`/`EditReportDialog` for save/edit workflows.

**MUI Dialog Nesting**: When dialogs are nested (e.g., TypeDetailDrawer contains FieldEditorDialog), inner dialogs use `disableRestoreFocus` to prevent `aria-hidden` focus warnings.

## Metamodel

The default metamodel seeds 13 card types across 4 layers and 30+ relation types. Created on first startup by `backend/app/services/seed.py`.

### Fields Schema Structure

Each type has a `fields_schema` (JSONB array of sections):
```json
[
  {
    "section": "Section Name",
    "columns": 1,
    "groups": ["Group Name"],
    "fields": [
      {
        "key": "fieldKey",
        "label": "Display Label",
        "type": "text|number|cost|boolean|date|url|single_select|multiple_select",
        "options": [{"key": "k", "label": "L", "color": "#hex"}],
        "required": false,
        "weight": 1,
        "readonly": false,
        "column": 0,
        "group": "Group Name"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The special section name `__description` feeds extra fields into the Description section. All other sections are rendered as custom `AttributeSection` components.

### Section Config

Each type has an optional `section_config` (JSONB) controlling layout:
```json
{
  "__order": ["description", "eol", "lifecycle", "custom:0", "custom:1", "hierarchy", "relations"],
  "description": { "defaultExpanded": true, "hidden": false },
  "custom:0": { "defaultExpanded": true, "hidden": false }
}
```

### Field Types

| Type | Description | Rendering |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `text` | Plain text | TextField |
| `number` | Numeric | NumberField |
| `cost` | Numeric with currency formatting | NumberField + currency symbol |
| `boolean` | Toggle | Switch |
| `date` | ISO date | DatePicker |
| `url` | Validated URL (http/https/mailto) | Clickable link input |
| `single_select` | Single choice from options | Select dropdown |
| `multiple_select` | Multiple choices from options | Multi-select chips |

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

### Multi-level Permission System

1. **App-level Roles** (`roles` table): System-wide roles like admin, member, viewer, bpm_admin. Each role has a JSONB `permissions` field with granular capability flags. Cached with 5-minute TTL by `PermissionService`. Admin role uses `{"*": true}` wildcard.

2. **Stakeholder Roles** (`stakeholder_role_definitions`): Per-card-type role definitions. Each card type can define custom roles (e.g., Application → "technical_application_owner"). Roles carry per-type permissions.

3. **Stakeholders** (`stakeholders` table): User ↔ card assignments with a specific role. A user can hold multiple stakeholder roles on different cards.

4. **Effective Permissions**: For any user + card combination, the system computes the union of:
   - App-level role permissions (with app→card permission mapping from `core/permissions.py`)
   - All stakeholder role permissions the user holds on that card
   - Result exposed via `GET /cards/{id}/effective-permissions`

### Permission Key Registry (`core/permissions.py`)

Single source of truth for all valid permission keys. Two categories:

**App-level permissions** (27 groups, 70 keys): `inventory.*`, `relations.*`, `stakeholders.*`, `comments.*`, `documents.*`, `diagrams.*`, `bpm.*`, `ppm.*`, `reports.*`, `surveys.*`, `soaw.*`, `adr.*`, `tags.*`, `bookmarks.*`, `saved_reports.*`, `eol.*`, `web_portals.*`, `notifications.*`, `servicenow.*`, `turbolens.*`, `compliance.*` (view + manage for the GRC Compliance scanner — the CVE half of the old "Security & Compliance" tab was removed), `risks.*` (view + manage for the EA Risk Register), `grc.*`, `costs.*`, `ai.*`, `users.*`, `admin.*`

**Card-level permissions** (15 keys): `card.view`, `card.edit`, `card.archive`, `card.delete`, `card.approval_status`, `card.manage_stakeholders`, `card.manage_relations`, `card.manage_documents`, `card.manage_comments`, `card.create_comments`, `card.bpm_edit`, `card.bpm_manage_drafts`, `card.bpm_approve`, `card.manage_adr_links`, `card.manage_diagram_links`

### Permission Checking (Backend)
```python
# App-level check (raises 403 if denied)
await PermissionService.require_permission(db, user, "admin.metamodel")

# Combined app + card-level check
await PermissionService.require_permission(db, user, "inventory.edit", card_id=card_id, card_permission="card.edit")

# FastAPI dependency (in route decorator)
@router.post("/...", dependencies=[Depends(require_permission("inventory.create"))])

# Check without raising
has_access = await PermissionService.check_permission(db, user, "bpm.edit")
```

### Default Seeded Roles

| Role | Key | Wildcard | Notable Restrictions |
|------|-----|----------|---------------------|
| Admin | `admin` | `{"*": true}` | Full access to everything |
| BPM Admin | `bpm_admin` | No | All BPM permissions + full inventory, no admin.* |
| Member | `member` | No | Full inventory + BPM edit (no approve), no admin.* |
| Viewer | `viewer` | No | View-only across all domains, can respond to surveys |

---

## Calculations (Computed Fields)

Admin-defined formulas that automatically compute field values when cards are saved.

### Engine (`calculation_engine.py`)
- Safe sandboxed evaluation using `simpleeval`
- **Built-in functions**: IF, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT, ROUND, ABS, COALESCE, LOWER, UPPER, CONCAT, CONTAINS, PLUCK, FILTER, MAP_SCORE
- **Context variables**: Card attributes, relations data, lifecycle info
- Automatic execution on card save via `run_calculations_for_card()`
- Dependency ordering via `execution_order` field

### Example Formulas
```
SUM(PLUCK(related_applications, "costTotalAnnual"))
IF(riskLevel == "critical", 100, IF(riskLevel == "high", 75, 25))
COUNT(FILTER(related_interfaces, "status", "ACTIVE"))
```

---

## BPM (Business Process Management)

### Architecture
- **BusinessProcess** card type with fields: process type, maturity level, automation level, risk level, frequency
- **BPMN 2.0 Editor**: bpmn-js integration with 6 starter templates
- **Element Extraction**: `bpmn_parser.py` extracts tasks, events, gateways, lanes from BPMN XML
- **Element Linking**: `ElementLinker.tsx` connects BPMN elements to Application/DataObject/ITComponent cards
- **Approval Workflow**: Process flows go through draft → pending → published → archived states

### BPM Reports
- Process maturity dashboard
- Risk assessment overview
- Automation level analysis

### Card Detail Integration
BusinessProcess cards show extra tabs in CardDetail:
- **Process Flow** tab: Embedded BPMN viewer/editor
- **Assessments** tab: Process assessment scores

---

## PPM (Project Portfolio Management)

Optional module (toggled via admin settings) for managing Initiative cards as full projects.

### Architecture
- **Scoped to Initiative cards** — All PPM data (reports, WBS, tasks, budgets, costs, risks) is linked to Initiative cards via `initiative_id` FK
- **Feature flag**: `usePpmEnabled()` hook (module-level singleton cache, fetches `GET /settings/ppm-enabled`)
- **Cost sync**: Creating/updating/deleting budget or cost lines auto-syncs the Initiative card's `costBudget` and `costActual` attributes and recalculates data quality
- **WBS rollup**: Task status changes trigger bottom-up completion recalculation through the WBS hierarchy
- **Task-Todo sync**: Assigning a PPM task auto-creates a system Todo (`is_system=true`); clearing assignee deletes it
- **Notifications**: Task assignment sends a `task_assigned` notification
- **Permissions**: `ppm.view` (read) and `ppm.manage` (write), granted to admin, bpm_admin, and member roles

### Frontend Components
- **`PpmPortfolio.tsx`** — Portfolio dashboard with Gantt visualization, KPI cards, grouping by related card type
- **`PpmProjectDetail.tsx`** — Tabbed initiative detail (overview, reports, cost, risks, tasks, gantt, details)
- **`PpmTaskBoard.tsx`** — Kanban board with @dnd-kit drag-drop (todo/in_progress/done/blocked columns)
- **`PpmRiskTab.tsx`** — Risk matrix visualization (probability x impact grid) and risk cards
- **`PpmCostTab.tsx`** — Budget lines (planned by fiscal year) and cost lines (actuals)
- **`PpmGanttTab.tsx`** — Timeline view of WBS items with milestones and completion bars

### Demo Data
`seed_demo_ppm.py` populates PPM data for 6 Initiative cards when `SEED_DEMO=true` or `SEED_PPM=true`. Includes status reports, WBS hierarchies, tasks, budget/cost lines, and risks with varied project health stories.

## TurboLens (AI-Powered EA Intelligence)

Native AI analysis module — originally ported from [ArchLens](https://github.com/vinod-ea/archlens) (MIT License, by [Vinod](https://github.com/vinod-ea)). Provides vendor analysis, duplicate detection, modernization assessment, and architecture AI recommendations using data directly from the `cards` table.

### Architecture
- **No separate container**: All logic runs natively in Turbo EA (FastAPI + PostgreSQL). No proxy layer, no SQLite.
- **AI infrastructure reuse**: Uses the same AI provider config from `app_settings.general_settings.ai` (supports Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini).
- **Background tasks + polling**: Long-running AI operations use FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` + `TurboLensAnalysisRun` status polling.
- **Direct data access**: Queries `cards`, `relations`, and `relation_types` tables via SQLAlchemy — no data copy or intermediate storage.
- **Session persistence**: The Architecture AI wizard saves progress to `sessionStorage` so users can navigate away and return without losing their place.

### Database Tables

| Table | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `turbolens_vendor_analysis` | `TurboLensVendorAnalysis` | AI-categorized vendors with category, sub-category, app counts, costs |
| `turbolens_vendor_hierarchy` | `TurboLensVendorHierarchy` | Resolved canonical vendor tree (parent-child, aliases, confidence) |
| `turbolens_duplicate_clusters` | `TurboLensDuplicateCluster` | Functional duplicate groups with evidence, recommendation, status |
| `turbolens_modernization_assessments` | `TurboLensModernization` | Modernization opportunities with effort, priority, current tech |
| `turbolens_analysis_runs` | `TurboLensAnalysisRun` | Analysis execution history (type, status, timestamps, errors, progress JSONB). Used by all TurboLens analyses including the `compliance` compliance scanner. |
| `turbolens_assessments` | `TurboLensAssessment` | Saved Architecture-AI wizard runs — requirement, selected objectives/capabilities, phase answers, chosen option, gaps + dependencies, target architecture payload. Surfaced by the `/turbolens` Assessments tab. |
| `compliance_findings` | `TurboLensComplianceFinding` | Compliance gap / attestation per regulation (EU AI Act, GDPR, NIS2, DORA, SOC 2, ISO 27001). Carries article, category, requirement, status, severity, gap, evidence, remediation, `ai_detected` flag for semantically-identified AI cards, and optional `risk_id`. |

### Backend Services

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `services/turbolens_ai.py` | Shared AI caller + JSON repair (truncation recovery, bracket balancing) |
| `services/turbolens_vendors.py` | Vendor categorization (45+ categories, batch=15) + resolution (batch=60, hierarchy building) |
| `services/turbolens_duplicates.py` | Duplicate detection (union-find merge, batch=40) + modernization assessment (batch=25) |
| `services/turbolens_architect.py` | 5-step architecture AI: objective-driven capability mapping, solution options, gap analysis, dependency analysis, and target architecture rendered with the Layered Dependency View |
| `services/compliance_scanner.py` | Compliance scanner orchestrator. Entry point (`run_compliance_scan`) that emits phase-aware progress to `run.results["progress"]`. Includes the EU AI Act **semantic detector** that flags cards embedding AI regardless of subtype. The legacy `run_security_scan` / `run_cve_scan` entry points have been removed — see `tests/services/test_compliance_scanner.py::test_service_exposes_compliance_scan_entry_point`. |
| `services/compliance_risk_sync.py` | Two-way bridge between compliance findings and the EA Risk Register (promote-to-risk + back-links). |

### Architecture AI Flow

The Architecture AI follows a 5-step guided wizard:

1. **Requirements** (Phase 0) — User enters a business requirement, selects existing Objective cards (autocomplete), and optionally selects or creates Business Capabilities (free-text for new ones).
2. **Business Fit** (Phase 1) — AI generates business clarification questions with typed inputs (text, single-choice, multi-choice with NFR categories).
3. **Technical Fit** (Phase 2) — AI generates technical deep-dive questions.
4. **Solution** (Phase 3) — Three sub-phases:
   - **3a: Options** — AI generates solution option cards (buy/build/extend/reuse) with impact preview (new/modified/retired components, integrations), estimated cost, duration, and complexity.
   - **3b: Gap Analysis** — After selecting an option, AI identifies capability gaps with ranked market product recommendations (gold/silver/bronze). Users select products via checkboxes.
   - **3c: Dependencies** — After selecting products, AI identifies additional infrastructure/platform dependencies needed. Users select dependencies via checkboxes.
5. **Target Architecture** (Phase 5) — Capability mapping with matched capabilities (existing vs new), proposed new cards (typed per metamodel, including new BusinessCapabilities), proposed relations, and an interactive **Layered Dependency View** rendered via `C4DiagramView` (React Flow). Proposed nodes appear with dashed borders and a green "NEW" badge. Backend guardrails automatically enforce: every new Application links to a BusinessCapability, every new BusinessCapability links to selected Objectives, and orphan cards (no relations) are removed.
6. **Commit** — Save assessment, then commit via `CommitInitiativeDialog`: creates Initiative card (name defaults to selected option title, editable), all selected new cards with AI-generated descriptions, relations, and a draft ADR capturing the decision context, selected products, and alternatives. Changing approach resets the assessment for re-saving.

### Risk Register API (`/risks` + `/cards/{id}/risks`)

TOGAF-aligned Risk Register mounted at `/api/v1/risks`, plus a card sub-route for the Card Detail → Risks tab.

| Method | Path | Permission | Description |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|
| GET | `/risks` | `risks.view` | Paginated, filterable risk list (status, category, level, owner, card_id, source_type, search, overdue) |
| GET | `/risks/metrics` | `risks.view` | KPIs + initial and residual 4×4 matrices |
| GET | `/risks/{id}` | `risks.view` | Single risk + linked cards + owner display name |
| POST | `/risks` | `risks.manage` | Manual risk creation (auto-assigns `R-000123` reference) |
| PATCH | `/risks/{id}` | `risks.manage` | Update fields; recomputes derived levels; enforces status transitions; requires `acceptance_rationale` to move to `accepted` |
| DELETE | `/risks/{id}` | `risks.manage` | Delete risk + clean up the owner's system Todo |
| POST | `/risks/{id}/cards` | `risks.manage` | Link one or more cards (idempotent) |
| DELETE | `/risks/{id}/cards/{card_id}` | `risks.manage` | Unlink a single card |
| POST | `/risks/promote/compliance/{finding_id}` | `risks.manage` + `compliance.view` | Promote a compliance finding to a risk (idempotent — returns existing one if already promoted). Seeds title, description, category, probability/impact, links the finding's card, and **spawns a one-shot mitigation task from the finding's remediation text**. |
| GET | `/cards/{id}/risks` | `risks.view` | All risks linked to a card (used by CardDetail → Risks tab) |
| GET | `/risks/{id}/mitigation-tasks` | `risks.view` | List mitigation tasks for a risk (with full per-task occurrence history). |
| POST | `/risks/{id}/mitigation-tasks` | `risks.manage` | Create a mitigation task. Auto-creates occurrence #1 and a system Todo on the assignee. |
| PATCH | `/mitigation-tasks/{id}` | `risks.manage` | Update title / description / owner / recurrence / due date / is_active. Owner changes propagate to the current open occurrence (and its Todo); past completed occurrences stay frozen. |
| DELETE | `/mitigation-tasks/{id}` | `risks.manage` | Delete a task. Cascades to occurrences and removes the linked system Todos. |
| POST | `/mitigation-tasks/{id}/occurrences/{occ_id}/complete` | `risks.manage` **or** assignee of the occurrence | Mark an occurrence done. Snapshots `owner_at_completion`. For recurring tasks, opens the next occurrence with `due_date = previous_due_date + interval` (calendar-correct) and lands it as `scheduled` or `open` per the lead-time gate. For one-shot tasks, flips `is_active = false`. Returns 409 when called on a `scheduled` cycle ("activate it first"). |
| POST | `/mitigation-tasks/{id}/occurrences/{occ_id}/skip` | `risks.manage` | Skip a cycle (recurring tasks roll forward as usual, subject to the lead-time gate). |
| POST | `/mitigation-tasks/{id}/occurrences/{occ_id}/promote` | `risks.manage` | Manually promote a `scheduled` cycle to `open` immediately — short-circuits the daily promotion loop for the "I want to do the review early" case. Idempotent on already-open cycles. |
| GET | `/mitigation-tasks/{id}/occurrences` | `risks.view` | Full audit history for one task, including `owner_at_completion` snapshots and `activated_at` timestamps. |
| GET | `/risks/mitigation-tasks/export` | `risks.view` | Flat list of every mitigation task on every risk matching the same filter shape as `GET /risks` (status / category / level / owner / source_type / search / overdue / card_id). Used by the Risk Register's two-sheet `.xlsx` export so sheet 2 always matches what the user has on screen. |

Owner assignment on create / patch / promote auto-creates a single `is_system` Todo on the owner's Todos page (description `[Risk R-xxxxxx] title`, link back to the risk, due-date mirrors `target_resolution_date`, auto-done when the risk reaches mitigated / monitoring / accepted / closed) and fires a `risk_assigned` in-app + email-capable notification whenever the owner actually changes (including self-assignment — `risk_assigned` is whitelisted in `notification_service.allow_self_types`).

### Frontend Pages

| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/turbolens` | `TurboLensPage` | Tab container: Dashboard, Vendors, Resolution, Duplicates, Architect, Assessments, History. **No Security / Compliance tab** — compliance moved to `/grc?tab=compliance` when the CVE half of the old "Security & Compliance" feature was removed. |

## EA Risk Register (TOGAF Phase G)

Landscape-level risk register aligned to TOGAF ADM Phase G. Separate from `PpmRisk` (which is initiative-scoped). Lives as a tab inside the **GRC** page (`/grc?tab=risk`) with detail pages at `/grc/risks/:id`. The legacy `/ea-delivery/risks` and `/ea-delivery/risks/:id` paths redirect to the GRC routes.

### Tables

| Table | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `risks` | `Risk` | One row per risk. Fields: reference (`R-000123`), title, description, category, source_type / source_ref, initial + residual probability × impact (with derived level), owner_id, target_resolution_date, status, acceptance_rationale + accepted_by + accepted_at, created_by. **No `mitigation` text column** — mitigation is task-driven (see below). |
| `risk_cards` | `RiskCard` | M:N junction between risks and cards (composite PK risk_id + card_id, role defaulting to `affected`) |
| `risk_mitigation_tasks` | `RiskMitigationTask` | Owned mitigation activities attached to a risk. Each row carries a human-readable `reference` (`T-NNNNNN`, monotonic, `String(16)` — same shape as `risks.reference`). One-shot (default) or recurring (`recurrence_unit` = `days`/`weeks`/`months`/`years`, `recurrence_interval` ≥ 1). Carries title, description, current `owner_id`, `is_active` (flips false when a one-shot task completes), and **`lead_time_days`** (how many days before `due_date` the cycle is promoted from `scheduled` to `open` — smart per-unit defaults of 1/2/7/14 for daily/weekly/monthly/yearly, capped at half the cycle). |
| `risk_mitigation_task_occurrences` | `RiskMitigationTaskOccurrence` | One row per scheduled instance of a task. Captures `sequence` (monotonic per task), `due_date`, `assigned_owner_id` (snapshot when the cycle opens), `status` (`scheduled` / `open` / `done` / `skipped`), **`activated_at`** (stamp when a scheduled cycle was promoted to open — NULL on cycles that were never gated), `completed_at` / `completed_by` / **`owner_at_completion`** (snapshot when the cycle closes — may differ from `assigned_owner_id` if the owner was changed mid-cycle), and `completion_notes`. Recurring tasks roll forward calendar-correctly on completion: `next_due = due_date + interval`, day-of-month clamped (Jan 31 + 1 month → Feb 28); the new cycle lands as `scheduled` if today is outside `due_date - lead_time_days`, `open` otherwise. |

The `compliance_findings` table also carries a nullable `risk_id` back-link so findings that have been promoted show **Open risk R-000123** instead of **Create risk** (idempotent promotion). Promoting a finding now spawns a one-shot mitigation task seeded from the finding's `remediation` text instead of writing free-text guidance into the dropped `mitigation` column.

### Backend modules

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `models/risk.py` | `Risk` + `RiskCard` SQLAlchemy models |
| `schemas/risk.py` | Pydantic I/O models with typed literals for category, level, probability, impact, status |
| `services/risk_service.py` | Pure helpers: `derive_level` (4×4 probability × impact matrix), `validate_status_transition`, `next_reference` (`R-000001` monotonic), `link_cards`, `promote_compliance_finding`, `risk_to_dict`, `compute_metrics`, `build_level_matrix` |
| `services/risk_mitigation_task_service.py` | Mitigation-task lifecycle: `compute_next_due` (calendar-correct month/year math via `_add_months`), `create_task_with_first_occurrence`, `complete_occurrence` / `skip_occurrence` (snapshots `owner_at_completion`, deactivates one-shot tasks, rolls forward recurring tasks), `apply_task_owner_change` (propagates parent-task owner edits to the current open occurrence — past occurrences stay frozen), `sync_occurrence_todo` (mirrors `sync_owner_todo` but keyed per open occurrence), `publish_task_event` (fan-out to linked cards). |
| `api/v1/risks.py` | CRUD + card linking + promote + metrics + `GET /cards/{id}/risks`. Includes `sync_owner_todo()` which creates / updates / deletes an `is_system` Todo on the owner and fires a `risk_assigned` notification whenever the owner changes (self-assignment included — whitelisted in `allow_self_types`). |
| `api/v1/risk_mitigation_tasks.py` | Mitigation-task endpoints. `GET/POST /risks/{id}/mitigation-tasks`, `PATCH/DELETE /mitigation-tasks/{id}`, `POST /mitigation-tasks/{id}/occurrences/{occ_id}/complete` and `/skip`, `GET /mitigation-tasks/{id}/occurrences` (full audit history). Permission: `risks.view` to read; `risks.manage` to mutate; **carve-out** — a user without `risks.manage` who is the `assigned_owner_id` of an open occurrence can complete that occurrence so assignees don't have to escalate just to mark their own control review done. Skip always requires full `risks.manage`. |

### Key behaviour

- **Status workflow** is sequential with explicit side actions. The UI renders one primary **Next step** button per state (Start analysis → Plan mitigation → Start mitigation → Mark mitigated → Start monitoring → Close) plus secondary actions for Accept risk / Resume mitigation / Reopen. Accepting requires a rationale; acceptance user + timestamp are captured on the record.
- **Derived levels** (`initial_level`, `residual_level`) are computed server-side via `derive_level()` and treated as read-only by the API layer.
- **Promote-from-finding** is idempotent — the compliance finding's `risk_id` is populated on promotion and a re-promote returns the existing risk.
- **Owner → Todo → Notification** loop: assignment (from create, patch, or promote) creates a linked Todo on the owner's Todos page and sends an in-app + email-capable `risk_assigned` notification. The Todo auto-marks done when the risk reaches `mitigated` / `monitoring` / `accepted` / `closed`, and is removed when the owner is cleared or the risk is deleted.
- **Task-driven mitigation.** Mitigation is captured as owned tasks under `risk_mitigation_tasks` rather than free-text. Tasks are one-shot by default; setting `recurrence_unit` (`days` / `weeks` / `months` / `years`) plus `recurrence_interval` ≥ 1 makes them recurring controls (e.g. "Check access rights every 6 months"). Recurrence is **completion-driven** — on close (done or skipped) of one occurrence, the next occurrence opens with `due_date = previous_due_date + interval`. Each occurrence snapshots `assigned_owner_id` at open and `owner_at_completion` at close, so the audit answer to "who signed off on the Jan 2024 review?" is preserved even after years of owner rotation. **Lead-time gating** (`lead_time_days` on the task) controls when a cycle becomes visible to the assignee: a new cycle lands as `scheduled` (audit-visible but no Todo, no notification) when today is outside `due_date - lead_time_days`, and is promoted to `open` (Todo created, notification fired) by the **daily `_promote_recurring_tasks_loop()` background task** in `app.main` at 03:00 UTC. `POST /mitigation-tasks/{id}/occurrences/{occ_id}/promote` short-circuits the wait for `risks.manage` holders. Smart defaults per recurrence unit (1/2/7/14 for daily/weekly/monthly/yearly, capped at half the cycle); one-shot tasks default to 0. Per-occurrence system Todos sync to the assignee (link `/ea-delivery/risks/{risk_id}?task={task_id}#occurrence-{occurrence_id}`); a `task_assigned` notification fires on every fresh assignment / promotion (cycle rollover included, whitelisted for self). `risk_mitigation_task.*` events (`created` / `updated` / `activated` / `completed` / `skipped` / `deleted`) fan out to every linked card so the per-card history timeline picks them up; `activated_at` on the occurrence captures the promotion moment for audit. **Residual scoring stays manual** — task completion does **not** auto-adjust the residual matrix; the Risk Detail page surfaces "X/Y open · Z overdue" chips alongside the residual block as context for the human assessment (ISO 31000-aligned). Promoting a TurboLens compliance finding spawns a one-shot mitigation task from the finding's `remediation` text.

### Permissions

- `risks.view` — view the register, metrics, and the Risks tab on cards (admin / bpm_admin / member / viewer).
- `risks.manage` — create, edit, promote, delete, link cards, change status (admin / bpm_admin / member).

### Frontend modules

- `features/grc/risk/RiskMatrix.tsx` — shared 4×4 clickable heatmap used by Register and Detail pages.
- `features/grc/risk/CreateRiskDialog.tsx` — reused for manual create and for promoting compliance findings, including an Owner picker so assignment happens at creation time.
- `features/grc/risk/RiskRegisterPage.tsx` — register list view (embedded as a tab in GRC at `/grc?tab=risk`).
- `features/grc/risk/RiskDetailPage.tsx` — full TOGAF layout: Identification → Initial assessment → **Mitigation tasks panel** (replaces the old free-text field) → Residual assessment (with Owner autocomplete, Target date, residual matrix, task-summary chips for context) → Affected cards (M:N) → Status workflow (primary Next step + secondary side actions + stepper) → Audit.
- `features/grc/risk/mitigation/MitigationTasksPanel.tsx` — task list with per-task expandable history. Add / edit / complete / skip / delete actions.
- `features/grc/risk/mitigation/MitigationTaskDialog.tsx` — create / edit dialog (title, description, owner autocomplete, due date, "Repeats" Switch + unit/interval picker).
- `features/grc/risk/mitigation/CompleteOccurrenceDialog.tsx` — confirm + optional completion notes when marking an occurrence done or skipped.
- `features/grc/risk/mitigation/OccurrenceHistoryList.tsx` — read-only audit list per cycle, including the `owner_at_completion` snapshot.
- `features/grc/risk/mitigation/recurrenceLabel.ts` — pure helper that formats `(unit, interval)` → translation-aware label ("One-shot", "Every 6 months", etc.). Unit-tested.
- `features/cards/sections/RisksTab.tsx` — Card Detail → Risks tab listing all risks linked to that card.

## DrawIO Integration

### How It Works
1. **Build time**: Frontend Dockerfile clones `jgraph/drawio` v26.0.9
2. **Runtime**: Nginx serves DrawIO at `/drawio/` (same origin)
3. **Editor**: `DiagramEditor.tsx` loads DrawIO in a same-origin iframe
4. **Communication**: Direct DOM access to iframe's `mxGraph` API. Graph reference stored on `iframe.contentWindow.__turboGraph`

### Shape System (`src/features/diagrams/drawio-shapes.ts`)
Cards are represented as mxGraph cells with custom XML user objects:
```xml
<object label="App Name" factSheetId="uuid" factSheetType="Application" />
```

Key functions: `insertFactSheetIntoGraph()`, `insertPendingFactSheet()`, `markCellSynced()`, `expandFactSheetGroup()`, `scanDiagramItems()`, `stampEdgeAsRelation()`, `extractFactSheetIds()`

### Diagram Feature Components
- `DiagramSyncPanel.tsx` — Sync cards between diagram and EA inventory
- `CardSidebar.tsx` — Browse cards to drag onto diagram
- `CardPickerDialog.tsx` — Search and select cards
- `CreateOnDiagramDialog.tsx` — Create new cards directly from diagram shapes
- `RelationPickerDialog.tsx` — Create/manage relations from diagram edges

---

## ServiceNow Integration

Bi-directional sync between Turbo EA cards and ServiceNow CMDB.

- **Connections**: Multiple ServiceNow instances with credential management (encrypted)
- **Mappings**: Card type ↔ ServiceNow table mappings with field-level rules
- **Sync modes**: Pull (ServiceNow → Turbo), Push (Turbo → ServiceNow)
- **Staging**: Records staged for admin review before applying changes (skip_staging flag available)
- **Identity persistence**: `snow_identity_map` maintains ID mappings across syncs

---

## AI Description Suggestions

Optional feature that uses a local LLM (via Ollama or any Ollama-compatible provider) to generate card description suggestions. The pipeline combines web search context with LLM inference.

### Architecture
- **Two-step pipeline**: Web search (DuckDuckGo/Google/SearXNG) → LLM description generation
- **Description-only**: Suggestions are limited to the `description` field — not arbitrary metadata fields
- **Type-aware prompting**: Search queries and LLM system prompts are customized per card type (e.g., "Application" → "software application", "ITComponent" → "technology product")
- **Confidence scoring**: Each suggestion includes a 0–100% confidence score for user transparency
- **Source attribution**: Web search sources are displayed as clickable links alongside suggestions

### Backend Components
- **`services/ai_service.py`**: Core orchestration — web search dispatch, LLM prompt building, response validation
- **`api/v1/ai_suggest.py`**: FastAPI endpoints (`POST /ai/suggest`, `GET /ai/status`)
- **`schemas/ai_suggest.py`**: Pydantic request/response models
- **Settings stored in**: `app_settings.general_settings.ai` (JSONB) — provider URL, model, search provider, enabled types

### Frontend Components
- **`AiSuggestPanel.tsx`**: Reusable UI showing suggestion with confidence badge, editable description, source links, and apply/dismiss buttons. Used in both `CardDetail` and `CreateCardDialog`
- **`AiAdmin.tsx`**: Admin settings page — toggle, provider URL, model selector, search provider, per-type enablement

### Search Providers
- **DuckDuckGo** (default): Zero-dependency HTML scraping fallback
- **Google Custom Search**: Requires API key + search engine ID (`API_KEY:CX` format)
- **SearXNG**: Self-hosted meta-search engine, JSON API

### Docker Integration
Ollama is available as an opt-in Docker Compose profile:
```bash
docker compose --profile ai up -d   # Starts Ollama alongside backend + frontend
```
The `ollama` service uses a persistent volume (`ollama_models`) and is only accessible internally. Set `AI_AUTO_CONFIGURE=true` to auto-detect and configure on first startup.

### Startup Automation (`main.py`)
- **Auto-configuration**: If `AI_AUTO_CONFIGURE=true` and AI is not yet configured in DB, writes env var values to `app_settings`
- **Model pulling**: Background task checks if the configured model exists in Ollama and pulls it if missing (10-minute timeout, non-blocking)

### Permission
- **`ai.suggest`**: Controls access to AI suggestion functionality. Granted to admin, bpm_admin, and member roles by default. Not available to viewers.

---

## Version Management

Single source of truth: `/VERSION` file at project root.

- **Backend**: `config.py` reads VERSION → exports `APP_VERSION` → exposed in `/api/health`
- **Frontend**: `vite.config.ts` reads VERSION → injects `__APP_VERSION__` global → displayed in user menu (AppLayout)
- **Docker**: Both Dockerfiles `COPY VERSION ./VERSION` before building
- **Local dev**: Frontend checks `../VERSION` (from frontend dir) then `./VERSION` (Docker)
- **Packaging metadata**: `backend/pyproject.toml` and `frontend/package.json` use a static `"0.0.0"` placeholder — do not bump them. This avoids triggering CI path filters on version-only changes.

## Security

This section covers the **runtime** security model of a deployed Turbo EA instance. For the **CI / supply-chain** side — what scanners cover what, Trivy/Scout/CodeQL/Dependabot wiring, allowlist procedures, image signing/verification — see [`.github/SECURITY_PIPELINE.md`](.github/SECURITY_PIPELINE.md).

### Startup Security
- App **refuses to start** with default `SECRET_KEY` in non-development environments
- In development mode, logs a warning about default key usage
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs are **disabled in production** (`ENVIRONMENT != "development"`)

### Encryption
- **Fernet symmetric encryption** (`core/encryption.py`) for database-stored secrets (SSO client secrets, SMTP passwords)
- Key derived from `SECRET_KEY` via SHA-256
- Values prefixed with `enc:` to distinguish encrypted from legacy plaintext
- `encrypt_value()` / `decrypt_value()` / `is_encrypted()` utilities

### Rate Limiting
- `slowapi` rate limiter in `core/rate_limit.py`
- Applied to auth-sensitive endpoints (login, register)

### Docker Hardening
- Non-root users: frontend runs as `nginx`, backend as `appuser`
- `cap_drop: ALL` + `no-new-privileges: true`
- Memory limits: backend 512M, frontend 256M
- Backend only exposed via internal Docker network (not to host)

### Nginx Security Headers
- Content-Security-Policy (strict, self-only with font/DrawIO exceptions)
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy: camera/microphone/geolocation disabled
- Request body limit: 5MB

### JWT Implementation
- PyJWT with HS256 algorithm in `core/security.py`
- Payload: `{sub: user_id, role: role_key, iat, exp, iss: "turbo-ea", aud: "turbo-ea"}`
- Issuer and audience validation on decode
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Token sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Frontend stores token in `sessionStorage` (not localStorage — cleared on tab close)

### Background Processes
- **Archived card auto-purge**: Background task runs hourly, permanently deletes cards archived for 30+ days (including their relations)
- **Ollama model pull**: On startup (if `AI_AUTO_CONFIGURE=true`), a background task checks if the configured LLM model exists and pulls it if missing (non-blocking, 10-minute timeout)

## Docker Architecture

### docker-compose.yml
Production-only stack with PostgreSQL, backend, frontend, edge nginx, and optional `mcp` / `ai` profiles:
- **db**: pulled from `ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/db:${TURBO_EA_TAG}`, persisted in the `postgres_data` volume
- **backend**: pulled from `ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/backend:${TURBO_EA_TAG}`, exposed only inside the compose network
- **frontend**: pulled from `ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/frontend:${TURBO_EA_TAG}`, exposed only inside the compose network
- **nginx**: pulled from `ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/nginx:${TURBO_EA_TAG}`, public entrypoint on `HOST_PORT`, proxies `/api`, `/mcp`, `/drawio`, and `/` to internal services
- **mcp-server**: optional profile `mcp`, pulled from `ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/mcp-server:${TURBO_EA_TAG}`
- **ollama**: optional profile `ai`, pulled from `ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/ollama:${TURBO_EA_TAG}`, persisted in the `ollama_models` volume

### dev/docker-compose.dev.yml
Development-only override that adds `build:` back to `db`, `backend`, `frontend`, `nginx`, `ollama`, and `mcp-server` using the root `Dockerfile` targets. Use it with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f dev/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

### GHCR Image Publishing (opt-in)
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` builds and pushes multi-arch (`amd64` + `arm64`) images to `ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/{db,backend,frontend,nginx,mcp-server}` on every push to `main`, every `v*.*.*` tag, and on `workflow_dispatch`. The **ollama** image is intentionally excluded from the matrix because it is just a thin non-root patch over `ollama/ollama:latest`; republish it manually with `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --target ollama -t ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/ollama:latest --push .` whenever upstream Ollama changes.
- **Compose usage**: production uses `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Development uses the `dev/docker-compose.dev.yml` file to build from source. Pin a version with `TURBO_EA_TAG=0.70.x` (defaults to `latest`).
- **Auth**: workflow uses the auto-provisioned `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`packages: write`); no extra secrets needed. Packages must be flipped to **Public** in GitHub package settings on first publish.

### Ollama Service (opt-in)
- **Profile**: `ai` — started with `docker compose --profile ai up -d`
- **Image**: `ghcr.io/vincentmakes/turbo-ea/ollama:${TURBO_EA_TAG}`, exposes port 11434 internally only
- **Volume**: `ollama_models` for persistent model storage
- **Memory**: Configurable via `OLLAMA_MEMORY_LIMIT` (default 4G)
- **Health check**: Uses `ollama list`

### Root Dockerfile (single file, multiple build targets)
All container images are built from one `/Dockerfile` at the repo root using multi-stage `--target` selection. Each `target` becomes a published GHCR image. Stages:

| Target | Base | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `backend-build` | `python:3.12-alpine` | Compile-time wheel/deps builder for backend |
| `backend` | `python:3.12-alpine` | Final backend image — copies `VERSION` + `backend/`, runs as non-root `appuser` |
| `db` | `postgres:18-alpine` | Bundled PostgreSQL image |
| `frontend-build` | `node:20-alpine` | Vite build of `frontend/` (consumes `VERSION` for `__APP_VERSION__`) |
| `drawio` | `alpine/git:v2.47.2` | Clones jgraph/drawio v26.0.9 |
| `frontend` | `nginx:alpine` | Final frontend image — built SPA + DrawIO assets, runs as non-root `nginx` |
| `nginx` | `nginx:alpine` | Edge nginx (public entrypoint, proxies `/api`, `/mcp`, `/drawio`, `/`) — config from `nginx/default.conf` |
| `ollama` | `ollama/ollama:latest` | Thin non-root patch over upstream Ollama |
| `mcp-server` | `python:3.12-alpine` | MCP server image — copies `VERSION` + `mcp-server/`, runs as non-root |

### Nginx Configuration
- `/api/*` → proxy to `backend:8000` (with SSE support headers)
- `/drawio/*` → static DrawIO assets (30-day cache, no-transform)
- `/*` → SPA fallback to `index.html`
- Security headers on all responses
- Static assets → 1-year cache with `immutable`
